;;; examples/safe/untrusted.scm -- Scheme file to be run in a safe
;;; environment.

;;; Commentary:

;;; This is an example file to be evaluated by the `safe' program in
;;; this directory.
;;;
;;; *Note* that the files in this directory are only suitable for
;;; demonstration purposes, if you have to implement safe evaluation
;;; mechanisms in important environments, you will have to do more
;;; than shown here -- for example disabling input/output operations.
