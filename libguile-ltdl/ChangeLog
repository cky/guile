	* upstream/Makefile.am (ltdl.h.diff): remove
	SCM_INSERTED_DLSYMLIST_STRUCT_DECL during diff computation.
	(ltdl.c.diff): remove SCM_INSERTED_DLSYMLIST_STRUCT_DECL during
	diff computation.

	* raw-ltdl.h: add SCM_INSERTED_DLSYMLIST_STRUCT_DECL so we can
	insert our own struct name here.

	* guile-ltdl.h: add scm_lt_dlsymlist typedef.
	(scm_lt_dlpreload_default): new function.  Replaces
	scm_lt_dlset_preloaded_symbols which depended on global that
	libtool automagically defines in binaries, not libs.

	* guile-ltdl.c (scm_lt_dlpreload_default): new function.  Replaces
	scm_lt_dlset_preloaded_symbols which depended on global that
	libtool automagically defines in binaries, not libs.  Now the call
	in guile.c has to pass us that magic value.
	(SCM_INSERTED_DLSYMLIST_STRUCT_DECL): used to add a struct name in
	the lt_dlsymlist typedef -- we use such a crazy name so we can
	remove this in the upstream diff computation.

	* upstream/Makefile.am (ltdl.h.diff, ltdl.c.diff): Create them in
	'.' not in 'upstream' since we are already in upstream.

2002-10-04  Rob Browning  <rlb@defaultvalue.org>

	* COPYING.LIB: moved from ../libltdl.

	* ChangeLog: moved from ../libltdl.

	* README: moved from ../libltdl.

	* Makefile.am: build new libguile-ltdl.

	* upstream/Makefile.am: new file.

	* upstream/ltdl.c: upstream source.

	* upstream/ltdl.h: upstream source.

	* guile-ltdl.h: main header file for guile's internal
	libguile-ltdl.

	* guile-ltdl.c: main source file for libguile-ltdl -- #includes
	raw-ltdl.c and raw-ldtl.h directly.  See README.

	* raw-ltdl.h: guile's modified version of the upstream ltdl.h.

	* raw-ltdl.c: guile's modified version of the upstream ltdl.c.
	(memcpy): coerce ptrs to (char *) before copying characters
	through them -- I can't recall for sure, but I believe this was
	causing an overrun error at times.
	(realloc): Remove custom realloc. (#define rpl_realloc realloc)
	and comment out later code for custom realloc.  You can't define
	your own malloc unless you know enough about the malloc in use to
	be able to tell how big the src ptr is.  The disabled code
	incorrectly used the *destination* ptr to decide how much to copy.
	This sometimes results in out-of-bound accesses which cause
	segfaults.  This is a quick hack for now; we may want something
	cleaner later.
	(tryall_dlopen_module): check to be sure (dirname_len > 0) before
	testing first character against '/'.
	(try_dlopen): check for feof(file) in read loop -- otherwise
	infloop?
	(scm_lt_dlopenext): remove unused variable file_found.
	(LT_EOS_CHAR): moved here from guile-ltdl.h.

2002-10-04  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* raw-ltdl.c: Renamed all exported functions and variables to have a
	"scm_lt_" prefix.
	(try_dlopen): Set newhandle to null when try_all_dlopen failed.
	(scm_lt_dlopenext): Reverse test of "file_not_found()".
	Previously, we would stop searching when the file wasn't found
	yet, while we should continue in that case.
