@c Notes
@c
@c We no longer use the category "primitive" to distinguish C-defined
@c Scheme procedures from those defined in Scheme.  Instead, the
@c reference manual now includes a C declaration as well as a Scheme
@c declaration for each procedure that is available in both Scheme and
@c C.
@c
@c When adding a new reference entry to the Guile manual, please
@c document it with @deffn using one of the following categories:
@c
@c   {Scheme Procedure}
@c   {Scheme Syntax}
@c   {C Function}
@c   {C Macro}
@c
@c If the entry is for a new primitive, it should have both a @deffn
@c {Scheme Procedure} line and a @deffnx {C Function} line; see the
@c manual source for plenty of existing examples of this.
@c
@c For {C Function} entries where the return type and all parameter
@c types are SCM, we omit the SCMs.  This is easier to read and also
@c gets round the problem that Texinfo doesn't allow a @deftypefnx
@c inside a @deffn.
@c
@c For a list of Guile primitives that are not yet incorporated into the
@c reference manual, see the file `new-docstrings.texi', which holds all
@c the docstrings snarfed from the libguile C sources for primitives
@c that are not in the reference manual.  If you have worked with some
@c of these concepts, implemented them, or just happen to know what they
@c do, please write up a little explanation -- it would be a big help.
@c Alternatively, if you know of any reason why some of these should
@c *not* go in the manual, please let the mailing list
@c <guile-devel@gnu.org> know.

@c Define indices that are used in the Guile Scheme part of the
@c reference manual to group stuff according to whether it is R5RS or a
@c Guile extension.
@defcodeindex rn

@c vnew - For (some) new items, indicates the Guile version in which
@c item first appeared.  In future, this could be made to expand to
@c something like a "New in Guile 45!" banner.
@macro vnew{VERSION}

@c  The following, @le{} and @ge{}, are standard tex directives, given
@c  definitions for use in non-tex.

@c  @cross{} is a \times symbol in tex, or an "x" in info.  In tex it works
@c  inside or outside $ $.
@tex
\gdef\cross{\ifmmode\times\else$\times$\fi}
@end tex
@ifnottex
@macro cross
x
@end macro

@c  @m{T,N} is $T$ in tex or @math{N} otherwise.  This is an easy way to give
@c  different forms for math in tex and info.
@iftex
@macro m {T,N}
@tex$\T\$@end tex
@end macro
@end iftex
@ifnottex
@macro m {T,N}
@math{\N\}
@end macro
@end ifnottex

@c  @nicode{S} is plain S in info, or @code{S} elsewhere.  This can be used
@c  when the quotes that @code{} gives in info aren't wanted, but the
@c  fontification in tex or html is wanted.  @alias is used rather
@c  than @macro because backslashes don't work properly in an @macro.
@ifinfo
@alias nicode=asis

@alias nicode=code

@chapter Programming in Scheme

Guile's core language is Scheme, and a lot can be achieved simply by using Guile
to write and run Scheme programs --- as opposed to having to dive into C code.
In this part of the manual, we explain how to use Guile in this mode, and
describe the tools that Guile provides to help you with script writing,
debugging and packaging your programs for distribution.

For detailed reference information on the variables, functions
etc. that make up Guile's application programming interface (API),
@xref{API Reference}.

@node Programming in C
@chapter Programming in C

This part of the manual explains the general concepts that you need to
understand when interfacing to Guile from C.  You will learn about how
the latent typing of Scheme is embedded into the static typing of C, how
the garbage collection of Guile is made available to C code, and how
continuations influence the control flow in a C program.

This knowledge should make it straightforward to add new functions to
Guile that can be called from Scheme.  Adding new data types is also
possible and is done by defining @dfn{smobs}.

The @ref{Programming Overview} section of this part contains general
musings and guidelines about programming with Guile.  It explores
different ways to design a program around Guile, or how to embed Guile
into existing programs.

For a pedagogical yet detailed explanation of how the data representation of
Guile is implemented, @xref{Data Representation}. You don't need to know the
details given there to use Guile from C, but they are useful when you want to
modify Guile itself or when you are just curious about how it is all done.

etc. that make up Guile's application programming interface (API),

@node Guile Implementation
@chapter Guile Implementation

At some point, after one has been programming in Scheme for some time,
another level of Scheme comes into view: its implementation. Knowledge
of how Scheme can be implemented turns out to be necessary to become
an expert hacker. As Peter Norvig notes in his retrospective on
PAIP@footnote{PAIP is the common abbreviation for @cite{Paradigms of
Artificial Intelligence Programming}, an old but still useful text on
Lisp. Norvig's retrospective sums up the lessons of PAIP, and can be
found at @uref{http://norvig.com/Lisp-retro.html}.}, ``The expert Lisp
programmer eventually develops a good `efficiency model'.''

By this Norvig means that over time, the Lisp hacker eventually
develops an understanding of how much her code ``costs'' in terms of
space and time.

This chapter describes Guile as an implementation of Scheme: its
history, how it represents and evaluates its data, and its compiler.
This knowledge can help you to make that step from being one who is
merely familiar with Scheme to being a real hacker.

@menu
* History::                          A brief history of Guile.
* Data Representation::              How Guile represents Scheme data.
* A Virtual Machine for Guile::      How compiled procedures work.
* Compiling to the Virtual Machine:: Not as hard as you might think.
