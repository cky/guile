@node Simple Data Types
@section Simple Generic Data Types

This chapter describes those of Guile's simple data types which are
primarily used for their role as items of generic data.  By
@dfn{simple} we mean data types that are not primarily used as
containers to hold other data --- i.e.@: pairs, lists, vectors and so on.
For the documentation of such @dfn{compound} data types, see
@ref{Compound Data Types}.

@c One of the great strengths of Scheme is that there is no straightforward
@c distinction between ``data'' and ``functionality''.  For example,
@c Guile's support for dynamic linking could be described:

@c @itemize @bullet
@c @item
@c either in a ``data-centric'' way, as the behaviour and properties of the
@c ``dynamically linked object'' data type, and the operations that may be
@c applied to instances of this type

@c @item
@c or in a ``functionality-centric'' way, as the set of procedures that
@c constitute Guile's support for dynamic linking, in the context of the
@c module system.
@c @end itemize

@c The contents of this chapter are, therefore, a matter of judgment.  By
@c @dfn{generic}, we mean to select those data types whose typical use as
@c @emph{data} in a wide variety of programming contexts is more important
@c than their use in the implementation of a particular piece of
@c @emph{functionality}.  The last section of this chapter provides
@c references for all the data types that are documented not here but in a
@c ``functionality-centric'' way elsewhere in the manual.

@node Booleans
@subsection Booleans
@tpindex Booleans

The two boolean values are @code{#t} for true and @code{#f} for false.

Boolean values are returned by predicate procedures, such as the general
equality predicates @code{eq?}, @code{eqv?} and @code{equal?}
(@pxref{Equality}) and numerical and string comparison operators like
@code{string=?} (@pxref{String Comparison}) and @code{<=}
(@pxref{Comparison}).

@lisp
(<= 3 8)
@result{} #t

(<= 3 -3)
@result{} #f

(equal? "house" "houses")
@result{} #f

(eq? #f #f)
@result{}
#t
@end lisp

In test condition contexts like @code{if} and @code{cond} (@pxref{if
cond case}), where a group of subexpressions will be evaluated only if a
@var{condition} expression evaluates to ``true'', ``true'' means any
value at all except @code{#f}.

@lisp
(if #t "yes" "no")
@result{} "yes"

(if 0 "yes" "no")
@result{} "yes"

(if #f "yes" "no")
@result{} "no"
@end lisp

A result of this asymmetry is that typical Scheme source code more often
uses @code{#f} explicitly than @code{#t}: @code{#f} is necessary to
represent an @code{if} or @code{cond} false value, whereas @code{#t} is
not necessary to represent an @code{if} or @code{cond} true value.

It is important to note that @code{#f} is @strong{not} equivalent to any
other Scheme value.  In particular, @code{#f} is not the same as the
number 0 (like in C and C++), and not the same as the ``empty list''
(like in some Lisp dialects).

In C, the two Scheme boolean values are available as the two constants
@code{SCM_BOOL_T} for @code{#t} and @code{SCM_BOOL_F} for @code{#f}.
Care must be taken with the false value @code{SCM_BOOL_F}: it is not
false when used in C conditionals.  In order to test for it, use
@code{scm_is_false} or @code{scm_is_true}.

@rnindex not

Return @code{1} if @var{obj} is @code{#f}, else return @code{0}.

Return @code{1} if @var{obj} is either @code{#t} or @code{#f}, else

Return @code{#f} if @var{val} is @code{0}, else return @code{#t}.
@end deftypefn

Return @code{1} if @var{val} is @code{SCM_BOOL_T}, return @code{0}
when @var{val} is @code{SCM_BOOL_F}, else signal a `wrong type' error.

You should probably use @code{scm_is_true} instead of this function
when you just want to test a @code{SCM} value for trueness.

@node Numerical Tower
@subsubsection Scheme's Numerical ``Tower''
@rnindex number?

Scheme's numerical ``tower'' consists of the following categories of
numbers:

@table @dfn
@item integers
Whole numbers, positive or negative; e.g.@: --5, 0, 18.

@item rationals
The set of numbers that can be expressed as @math{@var{p}/@var{q}}
where @var{p} and @var{q} are integers; e.g.@: @math{9/16} works, but
pi (an irrational number) doesn't. These include integers
(@math{@var{n}/1}).

@item real numbers
The set of numbers that describes all possible positions along a
one-dimensional line. This includes rationals as well as irrational
numbers.

@item complex numbers
The set of numbers that describes all possible positions in a two
dimensional space. This includes real as well as imaginary numbers
(@math{@var{a}+@var{b}i}, where @var{a} is the @dfn{real part},
@var{b} is the @dfn{imaginary part}, and @math{i} is the square root of
@minus{}1.)
@end table

It is called a tower because each category ``sits on'' the one that
follows it, in the sense that every integer is also a rational, every
rational is also real, and every real number is also a complex number
(but with zero imaginary part).

In addition to the classification into integers, rationals, reals and
complex numbers, Scheme also distinguishes between whether a number is
represented exactly or not.  For example, the result of
@m{2\sin(\pi/4),sin(pi/4)} is exactly @m{\sqrt{2},2^(1/2)} but Guile
can neither represent @m{\pi/4,pi/4} nor @m{\sqrt{2},2^(1/2)} exactly.
Instead, it stores an inexact approximation, using the C type
@code{double}.

Guile can represent exact rationals of any magnitude, inexact
rationals that fit into a C @code{double}, and inexact complex numbers
with @code{double} real and imaginary parts.

The @code{number?} predicate may be applied to any Scheme value to
discover whether the value is any of the supported numerical types.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} number? obj
@deffnx {C Function} scm_number_p (obj)
Return @code{#t} if @var{obj} is any kind of number, else @code{#f}.
@end deffn

For example:

@lisp
(number? 3)
@result{} #t

(number? "hello there!")
@result{} #f

(define pi 3.141592654)
(number? pi)
@result{} #t
@end lisp

@deftypefn {C Function} int scm_is_number (SCM obj)
This is equivalent to @code{scm_is_true (scm_number_p (obj))}.
@end deftypefn

The next few subsections document each of Guile's numerical data types
in detail.

@node Integers
@subsubsection Integers

@tpindex Integer numbers

@rnindex integer?

Integers are whole numbers, that is numbers with no fractional part,
such as 2, 83, and @minus{}3789.

Integers in Guile can be arbitrarily big, as shown by the following
example.

@lisp
(define (factorial n)
  (let loop ((n n) (product 1))
    (if (= n 0)
        product
        (loop (- n 1) (* product n)))))

(factorial 3)
@result{} 6

(factorial 20)
@result{} 2432902008176640000

(- (factorial 45))
@result{} -119622220865480194561963161495657715064383733760000000000
@end lisp

Readers whose background is in programming languages where integers are
limited by the need to fit into just 4 or 8 bytes of memory may find
this surprising, or suspect that Guile's representation of integers is
inefficient.  In fact, Guile achieves a near optimal balance of
convenience and efficiency by using the host computer's native
representation of integers where possible, and a more general
representation where the required number does not fit in the native
form.  Conversion between these two representations is automatic and
completely invisible to the Scheme level programmer.

The infinities @samp{+inf.0} and @samp{-inf.0} are considered to be
inexact integers.  They are explained in detail in the next section,
together with reals and rationals.

C has a host of different integer types, and Guile offers a host of
functions to convert between them and the @code{SCM} representation.
For example, a C @code{int} can be handled with @code{scm_to_int} and
@code{scm_from_int}.  Guile also defines a few C integer types of its
own, to help with differences between systems.

C integer types that are not covered can be handled with the generic
@code{scm_to_signed_integer} and @code{scm_from_signed_integer} for
signed types, or with @code{scm_to_unsigned_integer} and
@code{scm_from_unsigned_integer} for unsigned types.

Scheme integers can be exact and inexact.  For example, a number
written as @code{3.0} with an explicit decimal-point is inexact, but
it is also an integer.  The functions @code{integer?} and
@code{scm_is_integer} report true for such a number, but the functions
@code{scm_is_signed_integer} and @code{scm_is_unsigned_integer} only
allow exact integers and thus report false.  Likewise, the conversion
functions like @code{scm_to_signed_integer} only accept exact
integers.

The motivation for this behavior is that the inexactness of a number
should not be lost silently.  If you want to allow inexact integers,
you can explicitely insert a call to @code{inexact->exact} or to its C
equivalent @code{scm_inexact_to_exact}.  (Only inexact integers will
be converted by this call into exact integers; inexact non-integers
will become exact fractions.)

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} integer? x
@deffnx {C Function} scm_integer_p (x)
Return @code{#t} if @var{x} is an exact or inexact integer number, else
@code{#f}.

@lisp
(integer? 487)
@result{} #t

(integer? 3.0)
@result{} #t

(integer? -3.4)
@result{} #f

(integer? +inf.0)
@result{} #t
@end lisp
@end deffn

@deftypefn {C Function} int scm_is_integer (SCM x)
This is equivalent to @code{scm_is_true (scm_integer_p (x))}.

@defvrx {C Type} scm_t_uint64
@defvrx {C Type} scm_t_intmax
@defvrx {C Type} scm_t_uintmax
The C types are equivalent to the corresponding ISO C types but are
defined on all platforms, with the exception of @code{scm_t_int64} and
@code{scm_t_uint64}, which are only defined when a 64-bit type is
available.  For example, @code{scm_t_int8} is equivalent to
@code{int8_t}.

You can regard these definitions as a stop-gap measure until all
platforms provide these types.  If you know that all the platforms
that you are interested in already provide these types, it is better
to use them directly instead of the types provided by Guile.

@node Reals and Rationals
@subsubsection Real and Rational Numbers
@tpindex Real numbers
@tpindex Rational numbers

@rnindex real?
@rnindex rational?

Mathematically, the real numbers are the set of numbers that describe
all possible points along a continuous, infinite, one-dimensional line.
The rational numbers are the set of all numbers that can be written as
fractions @var{p}/@var{q}, where @var{p} and @var{q} are integers.
All rational numbers are also real, but there are real numbers that
are not rational, for example @m{\sqrt2, the square root of 2}, and
@m{\pi,pi}.

Guile can represent both exact and inexact rational numbers, but it
can not represent irrational numbers.  Exact rationals are represented
by storing the numerator and denominator as two exact integers.
Inexact rationals are stored as floating point numbers using the C
type @code{double}.

Exact rationals are written as a fraction of integers.  There must be
no whitespace around the slash:

@lisp
1/2
-22/7
@end lisp

Even though the actual encoding of inexact rationals is in binary, it
may be helpful to think of it as a decimal number with a limited
number of significant figures and a decimal point somewhere, since
this corresponds to the standard notation for non-whole numbers.  For
example:

@lisp
0.34
-0.00000142857931198
-5648394822220000000000.0
4.0
@end lisp

The limited precision of Guile's encoding means that any ``real'' number
in Guile can be written in a rational form, by multiplying and then dividing
by sufficient powers of 10 (or in fact, 2).  For example,
@samp{-0.00000142857931198} is the same as @minus{}142857931198 divided by
100000000000000000.  In Guile's current incarnation, therefore, the
@code{rational?} and @code{real?} predicates are equivalent.


Dividing by an exact zero leads to a error message, as one might
expect.  However, dividing by an inexact zero does not produce an
error.  Instead, the result of the division is either plus or minus
infinity, depending on the sign of the divided number.

The infinities are written @samp{+inf.0} and @samp{-inf.0},
respectivly.  This syntax is also recognized by @code{read} as an
extension to the usual Scheme syntax.

Dividing zero by zero yields something that is not a number at all:
@samp{+nan.0}.  This is the special `not a number' value.

On platforms that follow @acronym{IEEE} 754 for their floating point
arithmetic, the @samp{+inf.0}, @samp{-inf.0}, and @samp{+nan.0} values
are implemented using the corresponding @acronym{IEEE} 754 values.
They behave in arithmetic operations like @acronym{IEEE} 754 describes
it, i.e., @code{(= +nan.0 +nan.0)} @result{} @code{#f}.

The infinities are inexact integers and are considered to be both even
and odd.  While @samp{+nan.0} is not @code{=} to itself, it is
@code{eqv?} to itself.

To test for the special values, use the functions @code{inf?} and
@code{nan?}.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} real? obj
@deffnx {C Function} scm_real_p (obj)
Return @code{#t} if @var{obj} is a real number, else @code{#f}.  Note
that the sets of integer and rational values form subsets of the set
of real numbers, so the predicate will also be fulfilled if @var{obj}
is an integer number or a rational number.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} rational? x
@deffnx {C Function} scm_rational_p (x)
Return @code{#t} if @var{x} is a rational number, @code{#f} otherwise.
Note that the set of integer values forms a subset of the set of
rational numbers, i. e. the predicate will also be fulfilled if
@var{x} is an integer number.

Since Guile can not represent irrational numbers, every number
satisfying @code{real?} also satisfies @code{rational?} in Guile.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} rationalize x eps
@deffnx {C Function} scm_rationalize (x, eps)
Returns the @emph{simplest} rational number differing
from @var{x} by no more than @var{eps}.  

As required by @acronym{R5RS}, @code{rationalize} only returns an
exact result when both its arguments are exact.  Thus, you might need
to use @code{inexact->exact} on the arguments.

@node Complex Numbers
@subsubsection Complex Numbers
@tpindex Complex numbers

@rnindex complex?

Complex numbers are the set of numbers that describe all possible points
in a two-dimensional space.  The two coordinates of a particular point
in this space are known as the @dfn{real} and @dfn{imaginary} parts of
the complex number that describes that point.

In Guile, complex numbers are written in rectangular form as the sum of
their real and imaginary parts, using the symbol @code{i} to indicate
the imaginary part.

@lisp
3+4i
@result{}
3.0+4.0i

(* 3-8i 2.3+0.3i)
@result{}

@end lisp

@cindex polar form
@noindent
Polar form can also be used, with an @samp{@@} between magnitude and
angle,

-1@@1.57079 @result{} 0.0-1.0i  (approx)
@end lisp

Guile represents a complex number with a non-zero imaginary part as a
pair of inexact rationals, so the real and imaginary parts of a
complex number have the same properties of inexactness and limited
precision as single inexact rational numbers.  Guile can not represent
exact complex numbers with non-zero imaginary parts.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} complex? z
@deffnx {C Function} scm_complex_p (z)
Return @code{#t} if @var{x} is a complex number, @code{#f}
otherwise.  Note that the sets of real, rational and integer
values form subsets of the set of complex numbers, i. e. the
predicate will also be fulfilled if @var{x} is a real,
rational or integer number.

@node Exactness
@subsubsection Exact and Inexact Numbers
@tpindex Exact numbers
@tpindex Inexact numbers

@rnindex exact?
@rnindex inexact?
@rnindex exact->inexact
@rnindex inexact->exact

R5RS requires that a calculation involving inexact numbers always
produces an inexact result.  To meet this requirement, Guile
distinguishes between an exact integer value such as @samp{5} and the
corresponding inexact real value which, to the limited precision
available, has no fractional part, and is printed as @samp{5.0}.  Guile
will only convert the latter value to the former when forced to do so by
an invocation of the @code{inexact->exact} procedure.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} exact? z
@deffnx {C Function} scm_exact_p (z)
Return @code{#t} if the number @var{z} is exact, @code{#f}
otherwise.

@lisp

@end lisp

@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} inexact? z
@deffnx {C Function} scm_inexact_p (z)
Return @code{#t} if the number @var{z} is inexact, @code{#f}
else.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} inexact->exact z
@deffnx {C Function} scm_inexact_to_exact (z)
Return an exact number that is numerically closest to @var{z}, when
there is one.  For inexact rationals, Guile returns the exact rational
that is numerically equal to the inexact rational.  Inexact complex
numbers with a non-zero imaginary part can not be made exact.

@lisp
(inexact->exact 0.5)
@result{} 1/2
@end lisp

The following happens because 12/10 is not exactly representable as a
@code{double} (on most platforms).  However, when reading a decimal
number that has been marked exact with the ``#e'' prefix, Guile is
able to represent it correctly.

@end deffn


@node Number Syntax
@subsubsection Read Syntax for Numerical Data

The read syntax for integers is a string of digits, optionally
preceded by a minus or plus character, a code indicating the
base in which the integer is encoded, and a code indicating whether
the number is exact or inexact.  The supported base codes are:

@table @code
@item #b
@itemx #B
the integer is written in binary (base 2)

@item #o
@itemx #O
the integer is written in octal (base 8)

@item #d
@itemx #D
the integer is written in decimal (base 10)

@item #x
@itemx #X
the integer is written in hexadecimal (base 16)
@end table

If the base code is omitted, the integer is assumed to be decimal.  The
following examples show how these base codes are used.

@lisp
-13
@result{} -13

#d-13
@result{} -13

#x-13
@result{} -19

#b+1101
@result{} 13

#o377
@result{} 255
@end lisp

The codes for indicating exactness (which can, incidentally, be applied
to all numerical values) are:

@table @code
@item #e
@itemx #E
the number is exact

@item #i
@itemx #I
the number is inexact.
@end table

If the exactness indicator is omitted, the number is exact unless it
contains a radix point.  Since Guile can not represent exact complex
numbers, an error is signalled when asking for them.

@lisp
(exact? 1.2)
@result{} #f

(exact? #e1.2)
@result{} #t

(exact? #e+1i)
ERROR: Wrong type argument
@end lisp

Guile also understands the syntax @samp{+inf.0} and @samp{-inf.0} for
plus and minus infinity, respectively.  The value must be written
exactly as shown, that is, they always must have a sign and exactly
one zero digit after the decimal point.  It also understands
@samp{+nan.0} and @samp{-nan.0} for the special `not-a-number' value.
The sign is ignored for `not-a-number' and the value is always printed
as @samp{+nan.0}.

@node Bitwise Operations
@subsubsection Bitwise Operations

For the following bitwise functions, negative numbers are treated as
infinite precision twos-complements.  For instance @math{-6} is bits
@math{@dots{}111010}, with infinitely many ones on the left.  It can
be seen that adding 6 (binary 110) to such a bit pattern gives all
zeros.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} logand n1 n2 @dots{}
@deffnx {C Function} scm_logand (n1, n2)
Return the bitwise @sc{and} of the integer arguments.

@lisp
(logand) @result{} -1
(logand 7) @result{} 7
(logand #b111 #b011 #b001) @result{} 1
@end lisp
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} logior n1 n2 @dots{}
@deffnx {C Function} scm_logior (n1, n2)

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} logxor n1 n2 @dots{}
@deffnx {C Function} scm_loxor (n1, n2)

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} lognot n
@deffnx {C Function} scm_lognot (n)
Return the integer which is the ones-complement of the integer
argument, ie.@: each 0 bit is changed to 1 and each 1 bit to 0.

@lisp
(number->string (lognot #b10000000) 2)

@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} logtest j k
@deffnx {C Function} scm_logtest (j, k)
Test whether @var{j} and @var{k} have any 1 bits in common.  This is
equivalent to @code{(not (zero? (logand j k)))}, but without actually
calculating the @code{logand}, just testing for non-zero.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} ash n cnt
@deffnx {C Function} scm_ash (n, cnt)
Return @var{n} shifted left by @var{cnt} bits, or shifted right if
@var{cnt} is negative.  This is an ``arithmetic'' shift.

This is effectively a multiplication by @m{2^{cnt}, 2^@var{cnt}}, and
when @var{cnt} is negative it's a division, rounded towards negative
infinity.  (Note that this is not the same rounding as @code{quotient}
does.)

With @var{n} viewed as an infinite precision twos complement,
@code{ash} means a left shift introducing zero bits, or a right shift
dropping bits.

@lisp
(number->string (ash #b1 3) 2)     @result{} "1000"
(number->string (ash #b1010 -1) 2) @result{} "101"

@deffnx {C Function} scm_logcount (n)
Return the number of bits in integer @var{n}.  If @var{n} is
positive, the 1-bits in its binary representation are counted.
If negative, the 0-bits in its two's-complement binary
representation are counted.  If zero, 0 is returned.

@lisp

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} integer-length n
@deffnx {C Function} scm_integer_length (n)

For positive @var{n} this is how many bits to the most significant one
bit.  For negative @var{n} it's how many bits to the most significant
zero bit in twos complement form.

@lisp

@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} integer-expt n k
@deffnx {C Function} scm_integer_expt (n, k)
Return @var{n} raised to the power @var{k}.  @var{k} must be an exact
integer, @var{n} can be any number.

Negative @var{k} is supported, and results in @m{1/n^|k|, 1/n^abs(k)}
in the usual way.  @math{@var{n}^0} is 1, as usual, and that includes
@math{0^0} is 1.

@lisp

@deffnx {C Function} scm_bit_extract (n, start, end)
Return the integer composed of the @var{start} (inclusive)
through @var{end} (exclusive) bits of @var{n}.  The
@var{start}th bit becomes the 0-th bit in the result.

@lisp

@node Characters
@subsection Characters
@tpindex Characters

In Scheme, a character literal is written as @code{#\@var{name}} where
@var{name} is the name of the character that you want.  Printable
characters have their usual single character name; for example,
@code{#\a} is a lower case @code{a}.

Most of the ``control characters'' (those below codepoint 32) in the
@acronym{ASCII} character set, as well as the space, may be referred
to by longer names: for example, @code{#\tab}, @code{#\esc},
@code{#\stx}, and so on.  The following table describes the
@acronym{ASCII} names for each character.

@node Character Sets
@subsection Character Sets

The features described in this section correspond directly to SRFI-14.

The data type @dfn{charset} implements sets of characters
(@pxref{Characters}).  Because the internal representation of
character sets is not visible to the user, a lot of procedures for
handling them are provided.

Character sets can be created, extended, tested for the membership of a
characters and be compared to other character sets.

The Guile implementation of character sets currently deals only with
8-bit characters.  In the future, when Guile gets support for
international character sets, this will change, but the functions
provided here will always then be able to efficiently cope with very
large character sets.

@menu
* Character Set Predicates/Comparison::
* Iterating Over Character Sets::  Enumerate charset elements.
* Creating Character Sets::        Making new charsets.
* Querying Character Sets::        Test charsets for membership etc.
* Character-Set Algebra::          Calculating new charsets.
* Standard Character Sets::        Variables containing predefined charsets.
@end menu

@node Character Set Predicates/Comparison
@subsubsection Character Set Predicates/Comparison

Use these procedures for testing whether an object is a character set,
or whether several character sets are equal or subsets of each other.
@code{char-set-hash} can be used for calculating a hash value, maybe for
usage in fast lookup procedures.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} char-set? obj
@deffnx {C Function} scm_char_set_p (obj)
Return @code{#t} if @var{obj} is a character set, @code{#f}
otherwise.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} char-set= . char_sets

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} char-set<= . char_sets
@deffnx {C Function} scm_char_set_leq (char_sets)
Return @code{#t} if every character set @var{cs}i is a subset

@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} char-set-hash cs [bound]
@deffnx {C Function} scm_char_set_hash (cs, bound)
Compute a hash value for the character set @var{cs}.  If
@var{bound} is given and non-zero, it restricts the
returned value to the range 0 @dots{} @var{bound - 1}.
@end deffn

@c ===================================================================

@node Iterating Over Character Sets
@subsubsection Iterating Over Character Sets

Character set cursors are a means for iterating over the members of a
character sets.  After creating a character set cursor with
@code{char-set-cursor}, a cursor can be dereferenced with
@code{char-set-ref}, advanced to the next member with
@code{char-set-cursor-next}.  Whether a cursor has passed past the last
element of the set can be checked with @code{end-of-char-set?}.

Additionally, mapping and (un-)folding procedures for character sets are
provided.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} char-set-cursor cs
@deffnx {C Function} scm_char_set_cursor (cs)
Return a cursor into the character set @var{cs}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} char-set-ref cs cursor
@deffnx {C Function} scm_char_set_ref (cs, cursor)

@var{cursor} in the character set @var{cs}.  It is an error to
pass a cursor for which @code{end-of-char-set?} returns true.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} char-set-cursor-next cs cursor
@deffnx {C Function} scm_char_set_cursor_next (cs, cursor)

@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} char-set-unfold p f g seed [base_cs]
@deffnx {C Function} scm_char_set_unfold (p, f, g, seed, base_cs)

@itemize @bullet
@item @var{g} is used to generate a series of ``seed'' values
from the initial seed: @var{seed}, (@var{g} @var{seed}),
(@var{g}^2 @var{seed}), (@var{g}^3 @var{seed}), @dots{}
@item @var{p} tells us when to stop -- when it returns true
when applied to one of the seed values.
@item @var{f} maps each seed value to a character. These
characters are added to the base character set @var{base_cs} to
form the result; @var{base_cs} defaults to the empty set.

@node Strings
@subsection Strings
@tpindex Strings

Strings are fixed-length sequences of characters.  They can be created
by calling constructor procedures, but they can also literally get
entered at the @acronym{REPL} or in Scheme source files.

@c Guile provides a rich set of string processing procedures, because text
@c handling is very important when Guile is used as a scripting language.

Strings always carry the information about how many characters they are
composed of with them, so there is no special end-of-string character,
like in C.  That means that Scheme strings can contain any character,
even the @samp{#\nul} character @samp{\0}.

To use strings efficiently, you need to know a bit about how Guile
implements them.  In Guile, a string consists of two parts, a head and
the actual memory where the characters are stored.  When a string (or
a substring of it) is copied, only a new head gets created, the memory
is usually not copied.  The two heads start out pointing to the same
memory.

When one of these two strings is modified, as with @code{string-set!},
their common memory does get copied so that each string has its own
memory and modifying one does not accidently modify the other as well.
Thus, Guile's strings are `copy on write'; the actual copying of their
memory is delayed until one string is written to.

This implementation makes functions like @code{substring} very
efficient in the common case that no modifications are done to the
involved strings.

If you do know that your strings are getting modified right away, you
can use @code{substring/copy} instead of @code{substring}.  This
function performs the copy immediately at the time of creation.  This
is more efficient, especially in a multi-threaded program.  Also,
@code{substring/copy} can avoid the problem that a short substring
holds on to the memory of a very large original string that could
otherwise be recycled.

If you want to avoid the copy altogether, so that modifications of one
string show up in the other, you can use @code{substring/shared}.  The
strings created by this procedure are called @dfn{mutation sharing
substrings} since the substring and the original string share
modifications to each other.

If you want to prevent modifications, use @code{substring/read-only}.

Guile provides all procedures of SRFI-13 and a few more.

@node String Syntax
@subsubsection String Read Syntax

@c  In the following @code is used to get a good font in TeX etc, but
@c  is omitted for Info format, so as not to risk any confusion over
@c  whether surrounding ` ' quotes are part of the escape or are
@c  special in a string (they're not).

The read syntax for strings is an arbitrarily long sequence of
characters enclosed in double quotes (@nicode{"}).

Backslash is an escape character and can be used to insert the
following special characters.  @nicode{\"} and @nicode{\\} are R5RS
standard, the rest are Guile extensions, notice they follow C string
syntax.

@table @asis
@item @nicode{\\}
Backslash character.

@item @nicode{\"}
Double quote character (an unescaped @nicode{"} is otherwise the end
of the string).

@item @nicode{\0}
NUL character (ASCII 0).

@item @nicode{\a}
Bell character (ASCII 7).

@item @nicode{\f}
Formfeed character (ASCII 12).

@item @nicode{\n}
Newline character (ASCII 10).

@item @nicode{\r}
Carriage return character (ASCII 13).

@item @nicode{\t}
Tab character (ASCII 9).

@item @nicode{\v}
Vertical tab character (ASCII 11).

@item @nicode{\xHH}
Character code given by two hexadecimal digits.  For example
@nicode{\x7f} for an ASCII DEL (127).
@end table

@noindent
The following are examples of string literals:

@lisp
"foo"
"bar plonk"
"Hello World"
"\"Hi\", he said."

@node String Predicates
@subsubsection String Predicates

The following procedures can be used to check whether a given string
fulfills some specified property.

@rnindex string?
@deffn {Scheme Procedure} string? obj
@deffnx {C Function} scm_string_p (obj)
Return @code{#t} if @var{obj} is a string, else @code{#f}.
@end deffn

@deftypefn {C Function} int scm_is_string (SCM obj)
Returns @code{1} if @var{obj} is a string, @code{0} otherwise.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} string-null? str
@deffnx {C Function} scm_string_null_p (str)
Return @code{#t} if @var{str}'s length is zero, and

y                    @result{} "foo"
(string-null? y)     @result{} #f
@end lisp
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} string-any char_pred s [start [end]]
@deffnx {C Function} scm_string_any (char_pred, s, start, end)
Check if @var{char_pred} is true for any character in string @var{s}.

@var{char_pred} can be a character to check for any equal to that, or
a character set (@pxref{Character Sets}) to check for any in that set,
or a predicate procedure to call.

For a procedure, calls @code{(@var{char_pred} c)} are made
successively on the characters from @var{start} to @var{end}.  If
@var{char_pred} returns true (ie.@: non-@code{#f}), @code{string-any}
stops and that return value is the return from @code{string-any}.  The
call on the last character (ie.@: at @math{@var{end}-1}), if that
point is reached, is a tail call.

If there are no characters in @var{s} (ie.@: @var{start} equals
@var{end}) then the return is @code{#f}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} string-every char_pred s [start [end]]
@deffnx {C Function} scm_string_every (char_pred, s, start, end)
Check if @var{char_pred} is true for every character in string
@var{s}.

@var{char_pred} can be a character to check for every character equal
to that, or a character set (@pxref{Character Sets}) to check for
every character being in that set, or a predicate procedure to call.

For a procedure, calls @code{(@var{char_pred} c)} are made
successively on the characters from @var{start} to @var{end}.  If
@var{char_pred} returns @code{#f}, @code{string-every} stops and
returns @code{#f}.  The call on the last character (ie.@: at
@math{@var{end}-1}), if that point is reached, is a tail call and the
return from that call is the return from @code{string-every}.

If there are no characters in @var{s} (ie.@: @var{start} equals
@var{end}) then the return is @code{#t}.
@end deffn

@node String Constructors
@subsubsection String Constructors

@var{char_pred} can be a character, a character set, or a predicate
procedure to call on each character.  If @var{char_pred} is not given
the default is whitespace as per @code{char-set:whitespace}

@node String Modification
@subsubsection String Modification

These procedures are for modifying strings in-place.  This means that the
result of the operation is not a new string; instead, the original string's
memory representation is modified.

@rnindex string-set!
@deffn {Scheme Procedure} string-set! str k chr
@deffnx {C Function} scm_string_set_x (str, k, chr)
Store @var{chr} in element @var{k} of @var{str} and return

@end deftypefn

@rnindex string-fill!
@deffn {Scheme Procedure} string-fill! str chr [start [end]]
@deffnx {C Function} scm_substring_fill_x (str, chr, start, end)
@deffnx {C Function} scm_string_fill_x (str, chr)
Stores @var{chr} in every element of the given @var{str} and
returns an unspecified value.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} substring-fill! str start end fill
@deffnx {C Function} scm_substring_fill_x (str, start, end, fill)
Change every character in @var{str} between @var{start} and
@var{end} to @var{fill}.

@lisp
(define y "abcdefg")

y
@result{} "arrdefg"
@end lisp
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} substring-move! str1 start1 end1 str2 start2
@deffnx {C Function} scm_substring_move_x (str1, start1, end1, str2, start2)
Copy the substring of @var{str1} bounded by @var{start1} and @var{end1}
into @var{str2} beginning at position @var{start2}.
@var{str1} and @var{str2} can be the same string.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} string-copy! target tstart s [start [end]]
@deffnx {C Function} scm_string_copy_x (target, tstart, s, start, end)
Copy the sequence of characters from index range [@var{start},
@var{end}) in string @var{s} to string @var{target}, beginning
at index @var{tstart}.  The characters are copied left-to-right
or right-to-left as needed -- the copy is guaranteed to work,
even if @var{target} and @var{s} are the same string.  It is an
error if the copy operation runs off the end of the target
string.

@node String Comparison
@subsubsection String Comparison

The procedures in this section are similar to the character ordering
predicates (@pxref{Characters}), but are defined on character sequences.

The first set is specified in R5RS and has names that end in @code{?}.
The second set is specified in SRFI-13 and the names have no ending
@code{?}.  The predicates ending in @code{-ci} ignore the character case
when comparing strings.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} string=? s1 s2
Lexicographic equality predicate; return @code{#t} if the two
strings are the same length and contain the same characters in
the same positions, otherwise return @code{#f}.

The procedure @code{string-ci=?} treats upper and lower case
letters as though they were the same character, but
@code{string=?} treats upper and lower case as distinct
characters.

@node Conversion to/from C
@subsubsection Conversion to/from C

When creating a Scheme string from a C string or when converting a
Scheme string to a C string, the concept of character encoding becomes
important.

In C, a string is just a sequence of bytes, and the character encoding
describes the relation between these bytes and the actual characters
that make up the string.  For Scheme strings, character encoding is
not an issue (most of the time), since in Scheme you never get to see
the bytes, only the characters.

Well, ideally, anyway.  Right now, Guile simply equates Scheme
characters and bytes, ignoring the possibility of multi-byte encodings
completely.  This will change in the future, where Guile will use
Unicode codepoints as its characters and UTF-8 or some other encoding
as its internal encoding.  When you exclusively use the functions
listed in this section, you are `future-proof'.

Converting a Scheme string to a C string will often allocate fresh
memory to hold the result.  You must take care that this memory is
properly freed eventually.  In many cases, this can be achieved by
using @code{scm_dynwind_free} inside an appropriate dynwind context,
@xref{Dynamic Wind}.

@deftypefn  {C Function} SCM scm_from_locale_string (const char *str)
@deftypefnx {C Function} SCM scm_from_locale_stringn (const char *str, size_t len)
Creates a new Scheme string that has the same contents as @var{str}
when interpreted in the current locale character encoding.

For @code{scm_from_locale_string}, @var{str} must be null-terminated.

For @code{scm_from_locale_stringn}, @var{len} specifies the length of
@var{str} in bytes, and @var{str} does not need to be null-terminated.
If @var{len} is @code{(size_t)-1}, then @var{str} does need to be
null-terminated and the real length will be found with @code{strlen}.
@end deftypefn

@deftypefn  {C Function} SCM scm_take_locale_string (char *str)
@deftypefnx {C Function} SCM scm_take_locale_stringn (char *str, size_t len)
Like @code{scm_from_locale_string} and @code{scm_from_locale_stringn},
respectively, but also frees @var{str} with @code{free} eventually.
Thus, you can use this function when you would free @var{str} anyway
immediately after creating the Scheme string.  In certain cases, Guile
can then use @var{str} directly as its internal representation.
@end deftypefn

@deftypefn  {C Function} {char *} scm_to_locale_string (SCM str)
@deftypefnx {C Function} {char *} scm_to_locale_stringn (SCM str, size_t *lenp)
Returns a C string in the current locale encoding with the same
contents as @var{str}.  The C string must be freed with @code{free}
eventually, maybe by using @code{scm_dynwind_free}, @xref{Dynamic
Wind}.

For @code{scm_to_locale_string}, the returned string is
null-terminated and an error is signalled when @var{str} contains
@code{#\nul} characters.

For @code{scm_to_locale_stringn} and @var{lenp} not @code{NULL},
@var{str} might contain @code{#\nul} characters and the length of the
returned string in bytes is stored in @code{*@var{lenp}}.  The
returned string will not be null-terminated in this case.  If
@var{lenp} is @code{NULL}, @code{scm_to_locale_stringn} behaves like
@code{scm_to_locale_string}.
@end deftypefn

@deftypefn {C Function} size_t scm_to_locale_stringbuf (SCM str, char *buf, size_t max_len)
Puts @var{str} as a C string in the current locale encoding into the
memory pointed to by @var{buf}.  The buffer at @var{buf} has room for
@var{max_len} bytes and @code{scm_to_local_stringbuf} will never store
more than that.  No terminating @code{'\0'} will be stored.

The return value of @code{scm_to_locale_stringbuf} is the number of
bytes that are needed for all of @var{str}, regardless of whether
@var{buf} was large enough to hold them.  Thus, when the return value
is larger than @var{max_len}, only @var{max_len} bytes have been
stored and you probably need to try again with a larger buffer.
@end deftypefn

@node Regular Expressions
@subsection Regular Expressions
@tpindex Regular expressions

@cindex regular expressions
@cindex regex
@cindex emacs regexp

A @dfn{regular expression} (or @dfn{regexp}) is a pattern that
describes a whole class of strings.  A full description of regular
expressions and their syntax is beyond the scope of this manual;
an introduction can be found in the Emacs manual (@pxref{Regexps,
, Syntax of Regular Expressions, emacs, The GNU Emacs Manual}), or
in many general Unix reference books.

If your system does not include a POSIX regular expression library,
and you have not linked Guile with a third-party regexp library such
as Rx, these functions will not be available.  You can tell whether
your Guile installation includes regular expression support by
checking whether @code{(provided? 'regex)} returns true.

The following regexp and string matching features are provided by the
@code{(ice-9 regex)} module.  Before using the described functions,
you should load this module by executing @code{(use-modules (ice-9
regex))}.

@menu
* Regexp Functions::            Functions that create and match regexps.
* Match Structures::            Finding what was matched by a regexp.
* Backslash Escapes::           Removing the special meaning of regexp
                                meta-characters.
@end menu


@node Regexp Functions
@subsubsection Regexp Functions

By default, Guile supports POSIX extended regular expressions.
That means that the characters @samp{(}, @samp{)}, @samp{+} and
@samp{?} are special, and must be escaped if you wish to match the
literal characters.

This regular expression interface was modeled after that
implemented by SCSH, the Scheme Shell.  It is intended to be
upwardly compatible with SCSH regular expressions.

Zero bytes (@code{#\nul}) cannot be used in regex patterns or input
strings, since the underlying C functions treat that as the end of
string.  If there's a zero byte an error is thrown.

Patterns and input strings are treated as being in the locale
character set if @code{setlocale} has been called (@pxref{Locales}),
and in a multibyte locale this includes treating multi-byte sequences
as a single character.  (Guile strings are currently merely bytes,
though this may change in the future, @xref{Conversion to/from C}.)

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} string-match pattern str [start]
Compile the string @var{pattern} into a regular expression and compare
it with @var{str}.  The optional numeric argument @var{start} specifies
the position of @var{str} at which to begin matching.

@code{string-match} returns a @dfn{match structure} which
describes what, if anything, was matched by the regular
expression.  @xref{Match Structures}.  If @var{str} does not match
@var{pattern} at all, @code{string-match} returns @code{#f}.
@end deffn

Two examples of a match follow.  In the first example, the pattern
matches the four digits in the match string.  In the second, the pattern
matches nothing.

@example
(string-match "[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]" "blah2002")
@result{} #("blah2002" (4 . 8))

(string-match "[A-Za-z]" "123456")
@result{} #f
@end example

Each time @code{string-match} is called, it must compile its
@var{pattern} argument into a regular expression structure.  This
operation is expensive, which makes @code{string-match} inefficient if
the same regular expression is used several times (for example, in a
loop).  For better performance, you can compile a regular expression in
advance and then match strings against the compiled regexp.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} make-regexp pat flag@dots{}
@deffnx {C Function} scm_make_regexp (pat, flaglst)
Compile the regular expression described by @var{pat}, and
return the compiled regexp structure.  If @var{pat} does not
describe a legal regular expression, @code{make-regexp} throws
a @code{regular-expression-syntax} error.

The @var{flag} arguments change the behavior of the compiled
regular expression.  The following values may be supplied:

@defvar regexp/icase
Consider uppercase and lowercase letters to be the same when
matching.
@end defvar

@defvar regexp/newline
If a newline appears in the target string, then permit the
@samp{^} and @samp{$} operators to match immediately after or
immediately before the newline, respectively.  Also, the
@samp{.} and @samp{[^...]} operators will never match a newline
character.  The intent of this flag is to treat the target
string as a buffer containing many lines of text, and the
regular expression as a pattern that may match a single one of
those lines.
@end defvar

@defvar regexp/basic
Compile a basic (``obsolete'') regexp instead of the extended
(``modern'') regexps that are the default.  Basic regexps do
not consider @samp{|}, @samp{+} or @samp{?} to be special
characters, and require the @samp{@{...@}} and @samp{(...)}
metacharacters to be backslash-escaped (@pxref{Backslash
Escapes}).  There are several other differences between basic
and extended regular expressions, but these are the most
significant.
@end defvar

@defvar regexp/extended
Compile an extended regular expression rather than a basic
regexp.  This is the default behavior; this flag will not
usually be needed.  If a call to @code{make-regexp} includes
both @code{regexp/basic} and @code{regexp/extended} flags, the
one which comes last will override the earlier one.
@end defvar
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} regexp-exec rx str [start [flags]]
@deffnx {C Function} scm_regexp_exec (rx, str, start, flags)
Match the compiled regular expression @var{rx} against
@code{str}.  If the optional integer @var{start} argument is
provided, begin matching from that position in the string.
Return a match structure describing the results of the match,
or @code{#f} if no match could be found.

The @var{flags} argument changes the matching behavior.  The following
flag values may be supplied, use @code{logior} (@pxref{Bitwise
Operations}) to combine them,

@defvar regexp/notbol
Consider that the @var{start} offset into @var{str} is not the
beginning of a line and should not match operator @samp{^}.

If @var{rx} was created with the @code{regexp/newline} option above,
@samp{^} will still match after a newline in @var{str}.
@end defvar

@defvar regexp/noteol
Consider that the end of @var{str} is not the end of a line and should
not match operator @samp{$}.

If @var{rx} was created with the @code{regexp/newline} option above,
@samp{$} will still match before a newline in @var{str}.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} fold-matches regexp str init proc [flags]
Apply @var{proc} to the non-overlapping matches of @var{regexp} in

string or a compiled regexp.  The @var{flags} argument is as per
@code{regexp-exec} above.

@var{proc} is called as @code{(@var{proc} match prev)} where
@var{match} is a match structure and @var{prev} is the previous return
from @var{proc}.  For the first call @var{prev} is the given
@var{init} parameter.  @code{fold-matches} returns the final value
from @var{proc}.

For example to count matches,

@example
(fold-matches "[a-z][0-9]" "abc x1 def y2" 0
              (lambda (match count)
                (1+ count)))
@result{} 2
@end example
@end deffn

@sp 1
Regular expressions are commonly used to find patterns in one string
and replace them with the contents of another string.  The following
functions are convenient ways to do this.

@c begin (scm-doc-string "regex.scm" "regexp-substitute")
@deffn {Scheme Procedure} regexp-substitute port match [item@dots{}]
Write to @var{port} selected parts of the match structure @var{match}.
Or if @var{port} is @code{#f} then form a string from those parts and
return that.

Each @var{item} specifies a part to be written, and may be one of the
following,

@itemize @bullet
@item
A string.  String arguments are written out verbatim.

@item
An integer.  The submatch with that number is written
(@code{match:substring}).  Zero is the entire match.

@item
The symbol @samp{pre}.  The portion of the matched string preceding
the regexp match is written (@code{match:prefix}).

@item
The symbol @samp{post}.  The portion of the matched string following
the regexp match is written (@code{match:suffix}).
@end itemize

For example, changing a match and retaining the text before and after,

@example
(regexp-substitute #f (string-match "[0-9]+" "number 25 is good")
                   'pre "37" 'post)
@result{} "number 37 is good"
@end example

Or matching a @sc{yyyymmdd} format date such as @samp{20020828} and
re-ordering and hyphenating the fields.

@lisp
(define date-regex "([0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9])([0-9][0-9])([0-9][0-9])")
(define s "Date 20020429 12am.")
(regexp-substitute #f (string-match date-regex s)
                   'pre 2 "-" 3 "-" 1 'post " (" 0 ")")
@result{} "Date 04-29-2002 12am. (20020429)"
@end lisp
@end deffn


@c begin (scm-doc-string "regex.scm" "regexp-substitute")
@deffn {Scheme Procedure} regexp-substitute/global port regexp target [item@dots{}]
@cindex search and replace
Write to @var{port} selected parts of matches of @var{regexp} in
@var{target}.  If @var{port} is @code{#f} then form a string from
those parts and return that.  @var{regexp} can be a string or a
compiled regex.

This is similar to @code{regexp-substitute}, but allows global
substitutions on @var{target}.  Each @var{item} behaves as per
@code{regexp-substitute}, with the following differences,

@itemize @bullet
@item
A function.  Called as @code{(@var{item} match)} with the match
structure for the @var{regexp} match, it should return a string to be
written to @var{port}.

@item
The symbol @samp{post}.  This doesn't output anything, but instead
causes @code{regexp-substitute/global} to recurse on the unmatched
portion of @var{target}.

This @emph{must} be supplied to perform a global search and replace on
@var{target}; without it @code{regexp-substitute/global} returns after
a single match and output.
@end itemize

For example, to collapse runs of tabs and spaces to a single hyphen
each,

@example
(regexp-substitute/global #f "[ \t]+"  "this   is   the text"
                          'pre "-" 'post)
@result{} "this-is-the-text"
@end example

Or using a function to reverse the letters in each word,

@example
(regexp-substitute/global #f "[a-z]+"  "to do and not-do"
  'pre (lambda (m) (string-reverse (match:substring m))) 'post)
@result{} "ot od dna ton-od"
@end example

Without the @code{post} symbol, just one regexp match is made.  For
example the following is the date example from
@code{regexp-substitute} above, without the need for the separate
@code{string-match} call.

@lisp
(define date-regex "([0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9])([0-9][0-9])([0-9][0-9])")
(define s "Date 20020429 12am.")
(regexp-substitute/global #f date-regex s
                          'pre 2 "-" 3 "-" 1 'post " (" 0 ")")

@result{} "Date 04-29-2002 12am. (20020429)"
@end lisp
@end deffn


@node Match Structures
@subsubsection Match Structures

@cindex match structures

A @dfn{match structure} is the object returned by @code{string-match} and
@code{regexp-exec}.  It describes which portion of a string, if any,
matched the given regular expression.  Match structures include: a
reference to the string that was checked for matches; the starting and
ending positions of the regexp match; and, if the regexp included any
parenthesized subexpressions, the starting and ending positions of each
submatch.

In each of the regexp match functions described below, the @code{match}
argument must be a match structure returned by a previous call to
@code{string-match} or @code{regexp-exec}.  Most of these functions
return some information about the original target string that was
matched against a regular expression; we will call that string
@var{target} for easy reference.

@c begin (scm-doc-string "regex.scm" "regexp-match?")
@deffn {Scheme Procedure} regexp-match? obj
Return @code{#t} if @var{obj} is a match structure returned by a
previous call to @code{regexp-exec}, or @code{#f} otherwise.
@end deffn

@c begin (scm-doc-string "regex.scm" "match:substring")
@deffn {Scheme Procedure} match:substring match [n]
Return the portion of @var{target} matched by subexpression number
@var{n}.  Submatch 0 (the default) represents the entire regexp match.
If the regular expression as a whole matched, but the subexpression
number @var{n} did not match, return @code{#f}.
@end deffn

@lisp
(define s (string-match "[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]" "blah2002foo"))
(match:substring s)
@result{} "2002"

;; match starting at offset 6 in the string
(match:substring
  (string-match "[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]" "blah987654" 6))
@result{} "7654"
@end lisp

@c begin (scm-doc-string "regex.scm" "match:start")
@deffn {Scheme Procedure} match:start match [n]
Return the starting position of submatch number @var{n}.
@end deffn

In the following example, the result is 4, since the match starts at
character index 4:

@lisp
(define s (string-match "[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]" "blah2002foo"))
(match:start s)
@result{} 4
@end lisp

@c begin (scm-doc-string "regex.scm" "match:end")
@deffn {Scheme Procedure} match:end match [n]
Return the ending position of submatch number @var{n}.
@end deffn

In the following example, the result is 8, since the match runs between
characters 4 and 8 (i.e. the ``2002'').

@lisp
(define s (string-match "[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]" "blah2002foo"))
(match:end s)
@result{} 8
@end lisp

@c begin (scm-doc-string "regex.scm" "match:prefix")
@deffn {Scheme Procedure} match:prefix match
Return the unmatched portion of @var{target} preceding the regexp match.

@lisp
(define s (string-match "[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]" "blah2002foo"))
(match:prefix s)
@result{} "blah"
@end lisp
@end deffn

@c begin (scm-doc-string "regex.scm" "match:suffix")
@deffn {Scheme Procedure} match:suffix match
Return the unmatched portion of @var{target} following the regexp match.
@end deffn

@lisp
(define s (string-match "[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]" "blah2002foo"))
(match:suffix s)
@result{} "foo"
@end lisp

@c begin (scm-doc-string "regex.scm" "match:count")
@deffn {Scheme Procedure} match:count match
Return the number of parenthesized subexpressions from @var{match}.
Note that the entire regular expression match itself counts as a
subexpression, and failed submatches are included in the count.
@end deffn

@c begin (scm-doc-string "regex.scm" "match:string")
@deffn {Scheme Procedure} match:string match
Return the original @var{target} string.
@end deffn

@lisp
(define s (string-match "[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]" "blah2002foo"))
(match:string s)
@result{} "blah2002foo"
@end lisp


@node Backslash Escapes
@subsubsection Backslash Escapes

Sometimes you will want a regexp to match characters like @samp{*} or
@samp{$} exactly.  For example, to check whether a particular string
represents a menu entry from an Info node, it would be useful to match
it against a regexp like @samp{^* [^:]*::}.  However, this won't work;
because the asterisk is a metacharacter, it won't match the @samp{*} at
the beginning of the string.  In this case, we want to make the first
asterisk un-magic.

You can do this by preceding the metacharacter with a backslash
character @samp{\}.  (This is also called @dfn{quoting} the
metacharacter, and is known as a @dfn{backslash escape}.)  When Guile
sees a backslash in a regular expression, it considers the following
glyph to be an ordinary character, no matter what special meaning it
would ordinarily have.  Therefore, we can make the above example work by
changing the regexp to @samp{^\* [^:]*::}.  The @samp{\*} sequence tells
the regular expression engine to match only a single asterisk in the
target string.

Since the backslash is itself a metacharacter, you may force a regexp to
match a backslash in the target string by preceding the backslash with
itself.  For example, to find variable references in a @TeX{} program,
you might want to find occurrences of the string @samp{\let\} followed
by any number of alphabetic characters.  The regular expression
@samp{\\let\\[A-Za-z]*} would do this: the double backslashes in the
regexp each match a single backslash in the target string.

@c begin (scm-doc-string "regex.scm" "regexp-quote")
@deffn {Scheme Procedure} regexp-quote str
Quote each special character found in @var{str} with a backslash, and
return the resulting string.
@end deffn

@strong{Very important:} Using backslash escapes in Guile source code
(as in Emacs Lisp or C) can be tricky, because the backslash character
has special meaning for the Guile reader.  For example, if Guile
encounters the character sequence @samp{\n} in the middle of a string
while processing Scheme code, it replaces those characters with a
newline character.  Similarly, the character sequence @samp{\t} is
replaced by a horizontal tab.  Several of these @dfn{escape sequences}
are processed by the Guile reader before your code is executed.
Unrecognized escape sequences are ignored: if the characters @samp{\*}
appear in a string, they will be translated to the single character
@samp{*}.

This translation is obviously undesirable for regular expressions, since
we want to be able to include backslashes in a string in order to
escape regexp metacharacters.  Therefore, to make sure that a backslash
is preserved in a string in your Guile program, you must use @emph{two}
consecutive backslashes:

@lisp
(define Info-menu-entry-pattern (make-regexp "^\\* [^:]*"))
@end lisp

The string in this example is preprocessed by the Guile reader before
any code is executed.  The resulting argument to @code{make-regexp} is
the string @samp{^\* [^:]*}, which is what we really want.

This also means that in order to write a regular expression that matches
a single backslash character, the regular expression string in the
source code must include @emph{four} backslashes.  Each consecutive pair
of backslashes gets translated by the Guile reader to a single
backslash, and the resulting double-backslash is interpreted by the
regexp engine as matching a single backslash character.  Hence:

@lisp
(define tex-variable-pattern (make-regexp "\\\\let\\\\=[A-Za-z]*"))
@end lisp

The reason for the unwieldiness of this syntax is historical.  Both
regular expression pattern matchers and Unix string processing systems
have traditionally used backslashes with the special meanings
described above.  The POSIX regular expression specification and ANSI C
standard both require these semantics.  Attempting to abandon either
convention would cause other kinds of compatibility problems, possibly
more severe ones.  Therefore, without extending the Scheme reader to
support strings with different quoting conventions (an ungainly and
confusing extension when implemented in other languages), we must adhere
to this cumbersome escape syntax.


@node Symbols
@subsection Symbols
@tpindex Symbols

Symbols in Scheme are widely used in three ways: as items of discrete
data, as lookup keys for alists and hash tables, and to denote variable
references.

A @dfn{symbol} is similar to a string in that it is defined by a
sequence of characters.  The sequence of characters is known as the
symbol's @dfn{name}.  In the usual case --- that is, where the symbol's
name doesn't include any characters that could be confused with other
elements of Scheme syntax --- a symbol is written in a Scheme program by
writing the sequence of characters that make up the name, @emph{without}
any quotation marks or other special syntax.  For example, the symbol
whose name is ``multiply-by-2'' is written, simply:

@lisp
multiply-by-2
@end lisp

Notice how this differs from a @emph{string} with contents
``multiply-by-2'', which is written with double quotation marks, like
this:

@lisp
"multiply-by-2"
@end lisp

Looking beyond how they are written, symbols are different from strings
in two important respects.

The first important difference is uniqueness.  If the same-looking
string is read twice from two different places in a program, the result
is two @emph{different} string objects whose contents just happen to be
the same.  If, on the other hand, the same-looking symbol is read twice
from two different places in a program, the result is the @emph{same}
symbol object both times.

Given two read symbols, you can use @code{eq?} to test whether they are
the same (that is, have the same name).  @code{eq?} is the most
efficient comparison operator in Scheme, and comparing two symbols like
this is as fast as comparing, for example, two numbers.  Given two
strings, on the other hand, you must use @code{equal?} or
@code{string=?}, which are much slower comparison operators, to
determine whether the strings have the same contents.

@lisp
(define sym1 (quote hello))
(define sym2 (quote hello))
(eq? sym1 sym2) @result{} #t

(define str1 "hello")
(define str2 "hello")
(eq? str1 str2) @result{} #f
(equal? str1 str2) @result{} #t
@end lisp

The second important difference is that symbols, unlike strings, are not
self-evaluating.  This is why we need the @code{(quote @dots{})}s in the
example above: @code{(quote hello)} evaluates to the symbol named
"hello" itself, whereas an unquoted @code{hello} is @emph{read} as the
symbol named "hello" and evaluated as a variable reference @dots{} about
which more below (@pxref{Symbol Variables}).

@node Symbol Data
@subsubsection Symbols as Discrete Data

Numbers and symbols are similar to the extent that they both lend
themselves to @code{eq?} comparison.  But symbols are more descriptive
than numbers, because a symbol's name can be used directly to describe
the concept for which that symbol stands.

For example, imagine that you need to represent some colours in a
computer program.  Using numbers, you would have to choose arbitrarily
some mapping between numbers and colours, and then take care to use that
mapping consistently:

@lisp
;; 1=red, 2=green, 3=purple

(if (eq? (colour-of car) 1)
    ...)
@end lisp

@noindent
You can make the mapping more explicit and the code more readable by
defining constants:

@lisp
(define red 1)
(define green 2)
(define purple 3)

(if (eq? (colour-of car) red)
    ...)
@end lisp

@noindent
But the simplest and clearest approach is not to use numbers at all, but
symbols whose names specify the colours that they refer to:

@lisp
(if (eq? (colour-of car) 'red)
    ...)
@end lisp

The descriptive advantages of symbols over numbers increase as the set
of concepts that you want to describe grows.  Suppose that a car object
can have other properties as well, such as whether it has or uses:

@itemize @bullet
@item
automatic or manual transmission
@item
leaded or unleaded fuel
@item
power steering (or not).
@end itemize

@noindent
Then a car's combined property set could be naturally represented and
manipulated as a list of symbols:

@lisp
(properties-of car1)
@result{}
(red manual unleaded power-steering)

(if (memq 'power-steering (properties-of car1))
    (display "Unfit people can drive this car.\n")
    (display "You'll need strong arms to drive this car!\n"))
@print{}
Unfit people can drive this car.
@end lisp

Remember, the fundamental property of symbols that we are relying on
here is that an occurrence of @code{'red} in one part of a program is an
@emph{indistinguishable} symbol from an occurrence of @code{'red} in
another part of a program; this means that symbols can usefully be
compared using @code{eq?}.  At the same time, symbols have naturally
descriptive names.  This combination of efficiency and descriptive power
makes them ideal for use as discrete data.


@node Symbol Keys
@subsubsection Symbols as Lookup Keys

Given their efficiency and descriptive power, it is natural to use
symbols as the keys in an association list or hash table.

To illustrate this, consider a more structured representation of the car
properties example from the preceding subsection.  Rather than
mixing all the properties up together in a flat list, we could use an
association list like this:

@lisp
(define car1-properties '((colour . red)
                          (transmission . manual)
                          (fuel . unleaded)
                          (steering . power-assisted)))
@end lisp

Notice how this structure is more explicit and extensible than the flat
list.  For example it makes clear that @code{manual} refers to the
transmission rather than, say, the windows or the locking of the car.
It also allows further properties to use the same symbols among their
possible values without becoming ambiguous:

@lisp
(define car1-properties '((colour . red)
                          (transmission . manual)
                          (fuel . unleaded)
                          (steering . power-assisted)
                          (seat-colour . red)
                          (locking . manual)))
@end lisp

With a representation like this, it is easy to use the efficient
@code{assq-XXX} family of procedures (@pxref{Association Lists}) to
extract or change individual pieces of information:

@lisp
(assq-ref car1-properties 'fuel) @result{} unleaded
(assq-ref car1-properties 'transmission) @result{} manual

(assq-set! car1-properties 'seat-colour 'black)
@result{}
((colour . red)
 (transmission . manual)
 (fuel . unleaded)
 (steering . power-assisted)
 (seat-colour . black)
 (locking . manual)))
@end lisp

Hash tables also have keys, and exactly the same arguments apply to the
use of symbols in hash tables as in association lists.  The hash value
that Guile uses to decide where to add a symbol-keyed entry to a hash
table can be obtained by calling the @code{symbol-hash} procedure:

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} symbol-hash symbol
@deffnx {C Function} scm_symbol_hash (symbol)
Return a hash value for @var{symbol}.
@end deffn

See @ref{Hash Tables} for information about hash tables in general, and
for why you might choose to use a hash table rather than an association
list.


@node Symbol Variables
@subsubsection Symbols as Denoting Variables

When an unquoted symbol in a Scheme program is evaluated, it is
interpreted as a variable reference, and the result of the evaluation is
the appropriate variable's value.

For example, when the expression @code{(string-length "abcd")} is read
and evaluated, the sequence of characters @code{string-length} is read
as the symbol whose name is "string-length".  This symbol is associated
with a variable whose value is the procedure that implements string
length calculation.  Therefore evaluation of the @code{string-length}
symbol results in that procedure.

The details of the connection between an unquoted symbol and the
variable to which it refers are explained elsewhere.  See @ref{Binding
Constructs}, for how associations between symbols and variables are
created, and @ref{Modules}, for how those associations are affected by
Guile's module system.


@node Symbol Primitives
@subsubsection Operations Related to Symbols

Given any Scheme value, you can determine whether it is a symbol using
the @code{symbol?} primitive:

@rnindex symbol?
@deffn {Scheme Procedure} symbol? obj
@deffnx {C Function} scm_symbol_p (obj)
Return @code{#t} if @var{obj} is a symbol, otherwise return
@code{#f}.
@end deffn

@deftypefn {C Function} int scm_is_symbol (SCM val)
Equivalent to @code{scm_is_true (scm_symbol_p (val))}.
@end deftypefn

Once you know that you have a symbol, you can obtain its name as a
string by calling @code{symbol->string}.  Note that Guile differs by
default from R5RS on the details of @code{symbol->string} as regards
case-sensitivity:

@rnindex symbol->string
@deffn {Scheme Procedure} symbol->string s
@deffnx {C Function} scm_symbol_to_string (s)
Return the name of symbol @var{s} as a string.  By default, Guile reads
symbols case-sensitively, so the string returned will have the same case
variation as the sequence of characters that caused @var{s} to be
created.

If Guile is set to read symbols case-insensitively (as specified by
R5RS), and @var{s} comes into being as part of a literal expression
(@pxref{Literal expressions,,,r5rs, The Revised^5 Report on Scheme}) or
by a call to the @code{read} or @code{string-ci->symbol} procedures,
Guile converts any alphabetic characters in the symbol's name to
lower case before creating the symbol object, so the string returned
here will be in lower case.

If @var{s} was created by @code{string->symbol}, the case of characters
in the string returned will be the same as that in the string that was
passed to @code{string->symbol}, regardless of Guile's case-sensitivity
setting at the time @var{s} was created.

It is an error to apply mutation procedures like @code{string-set!} to
strings returned by this procedure.
@end deffn

Most symbols are created by writing them literally in code.  However it
is also possible to create symbols programmatically using the following
@code{string->symbol} and @code{string-ci->symbol} procedures:

@rnindex string->symbol
@deffn {Scheme Procedure} string->symbol string
@deffnx {C Function} scm_string_to_symbol (string)
Return the symbol whose name is @var{string}.  This procedure can create
symbols with names containing special characters or letters in the
non-standard case, but it is usually a bad idea to create such symbols
because in some implementations of Scheme they cannot be read as
themselves.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} string-ci->symbol str
@deffnx {C Function} scm_string_ci_to_symbol (str)
Return the symbol whose name is @var{str}.  If Guile is currently
reading symbols case-insensitively, @var{str} is converted to lowercase
before the returned symbol is looked up or created.
@end deffn

The following examples illustrate Guile's detailed behaviour as regards
the case-sensitivity of symbols:

@lisp
(read-enable 'case-insensitive)   ; R5RS compliant behaviour

(symbol->string 'flying-fish)    @result{} "flying-fish"
(symbol->string 'Martin)         @result{} "martin"
(symbol->string
   (string->symbol "Malvina"))   @result{} "Malvina"

(eq? 'mISSISSIppi 'mississippi)  @result{} #t
(string->symbol "mISSISSIppi")   @result{} mISSISSIppi
(eq? 'bitBlt (string->symbol "bitBlt")) @result{} #f
(eq? 'LolliPop
  (string->symbol (symbol->string 'LolliPop))) @result{} #t
(string=? "K. Harper, M.D."
  (symbol->string
    (string->symbol "K. Harper, M.D."))) @result{} #t

(read-disable 'case-insensitive)   ; Guile default behaviour

(symbol->string 'flying-fish)    @result{} "flying-fish"
(symbol->string 'Martin)         @result{} "Martin"
(symbol->string
   (string->symbol "Malvina"))   @result{} "Malvina"

(eq? 'mISSISSIppi 'mississippi)  @result{} #f
(string->symbol "mISSISSIppi")   @result{} mISSISSIppi
(eq? 'bitBlt (string->symbol "bitBlt")) @result{} #t
(eq? 'LolliPop
  (string->symbol (symbol->string 'LolliPop))) @result{} #t
(string=? "K. Harper, M.D."
  (symbol->string
    (string->symbol "K. Harper, M.D."))) @result{} #t
@end lisp

From C, there are lower level functions that construct a Scheme symbol
from a C string in the current locale encoding.

When you want to do more from C, you should convert between symbols
and strings using @code{scm_symbol_to_string} and
@code{scm_string_to_symbol} and work with the strings.

@deffn {C Function} scm_from_locale_symbol (const char *name)
@deffnx {C Function} scm_from_locale_symboln (const char *name, size_t len)
Construct and return a Scheme symbol whose name is specified by
@var{name}.  For @code{scm_from_locale_symbol}, @var{name} must be null
terminated; for @code{scm_from_locale_symboln} the length of @var{name} is
specified explicitly by @var{len}.
@end deffn

@deftypefn  {C Function} SCM scm_take_locale_symbol (char *str)
@deftypefnx {C Function} SCM scm_take_locale_symboln (char *str, size_t len)
Like @code{scm_from_locale_symbol} and @code{scm_from_locale_symboln},
respectively, but also frees @var{str} with @code{free} eventually.
Thus, you can use this function when you would free @var{str} anyway
immediately after creating the Scheme string.  In certain cases, Guile
can then use @var{str} directly as its internal representation.
@end deftypefn


Finally, some applications, especially those that generate new Scheme
code dynamically, need to generate symbols for use in the generated
code.  The @code{gensym} primitive meets this need:

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} gensym [prefix]
@deffnx {C Function} scm_gensym (prefix)
Create a new symbol with a name constructed from a prefix and a counter
value.  The string @var{prefix} can be specified as an optional
argument.  Default prefix is @samp{@w{ g}}.  The counter is increased by 1
at each call.  There is no provision for resetting the counter.
@end deffn

The symbols generated by @code{gensym} are @emph{likely} to be unique,
since their names begin with a space and it is only otherwise possible
to generate such symbols if a programmer goes out of their way to do
so.  Uniqueness can be guaranteed by instead using uninterned symbols
(@pxref{Symbol Uninterned}), though they can't be usefully written out
and read back in.


@node Symbol Props
@subsubsection Function Slots and Property Lists

In traditional Lisp dialects, symbols are often understood as having
three kinds of value at once:

@itemize @bullet
@item
a @dfn{variable} value, which is used when the symbol appears in
code in a variable reference context

@item
a @dfn{function} value, which is used when the symbol appears in
code in a function name position (i.e. as the first element in an
unquoted list)

@item
a @dfn{property list} value, which is used when the symbol is given as
the first argument to Lisp's @code{put} or @code{get} functions.
@end itemize

Although Scheme (as one of its simplifications with respect to Lisp)
does away with the distinction between variable and function namespaces,
Guile currently retains some elements of the traditional structure in
case they turn out to be useful when implementing translators for other
languages, in particular Emacs Lisp.

Specifically, Guile symbols have two extra slots. for a symbol's
property list, and for its ``function value.''  The following procedures
are provided to access these slots.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} symbol-fref symbol
@deffnx {C Function} scm_symbol_fref (symbol)
Return the contents of @var{symbol}'s @dfn{function slot}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} symbol-fset! symbol value
@deffnx {C Function} scm_symbol_fset_x (symbol, value)
Set the contents of @var{symbol}'s function slot to @var{value}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} symbol-pref symbol
@deffnx {C Function} scm_symbol_pref (symbol)
Return the @dfn{property list} currently associated with @var{symbol}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} symbol-pset! symbol value
@deffnx {C Function} scm_symbol_pset_x (symbol, value)
Set @var{symbol}'s property list to @var{value}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} symbol-property sym prop
From @var{sym}'s property list, return the value for property
@var{prop}.  The assumption is that @var{sym}'s property list is an
association list whose keys are distinguished from each other using
@code{equal?}; @var{prop} should be one of the keys in that list.  If
the property list has no entry for @var{prop}, @code{symbol-property}
returns @code{#f}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} set-symbol-property! sym prop val
In @var{sym}'s property list, set the value for property @var{prop} to
@var{val}, or add a new entry for @var{prop}, with value @var{val}, if
none already exists.  For the structure of the property list, see
@code{symbol-property}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} symbol-property-remove! sym prop
From @var{sym}'s property list, remove the entry for property
@var{prop}, if there is one.  For the structure of the property list,
see @code{symbol-property}.
@end deffn

Support for these extra slots may be removed in a future release, and it
is probably better to avoid using them.  (In release 1.6, Guile itself
uses the property list slot sparingly, and the function slot not at

@node Symbol Read Syntax
@subsubsection Extended Read Syntax for Symbols

The read syntax for a symbol is a sequence of letters, digits, and
@dfn{extended alphabetic characters}, beginning with a character that
cannot begin a number.  In addition, the special cases of @code{+},
@code{-}, and @code{...} are read as symbols even though numbers can
begin with @code{+}, @code{-} or @code{.}.

Extended alphabetic characters may be used within identifiers as if
they were letters.  The set of extended alphabetic characters is:

@example
! $ % & * + - . / : < = > ? @@ ^ _ ~
@end example

In addition to the standard read syntax defined above (which is taken
from R5RS (@pxref{Formal syntax,,,r5rs,The Revised^5 Report on
Scheme})), Guile provides an extended symbol read syntax that allows the
inclusion of unusual characters such as space characters, newlines and
parentheses.  If (for whatever reason) you need to write a symbol
containing characters not mentioned above, you can do so as follows.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Begin the symbol with the characters @code{#@{},

@item
write the characters of the symbol and

@item
finish the symbol with the characters @code{@}#}.
@end itemize

Here are a few examples of this form of read syntax.  The first symbol
needs to use extended syntax because it contains a space character, the
second because it contains a line break, and the last because it looks
like a number.

@lisp
#@{foo bar@}#

#@{what
ever@}#

#@{4242@}#
@end lisp

Although Guile provides this extended read syntax for symbols,
widespread usage of it is discouraged because it is not portable and not
very readable.


@node Symbol Uninterned
@subsubsection Uninterned Symbols

What makes symbols useful is that they are automatically kept unique.
There are no two symbols that are distinct objects but have the same
name.  But of course, there is no rule without exception.  In addition
to the normal symbols that have been discussed up to now, you can also
create special @dfn{uninterned} symbols that behave slightly
differently.

To understand what is different about them and why they might be useful,
we look at how normal symbols are actually kept unique.

Whenever Guile wants to find the symbol with a specific name, for
example during @code{read} or when executing @code{string->symbol}, it
first looks into a table of all existing symbols to find out whether a
symbol with the given name already exists.  When this is the case, Guile
just returns that symbol.  When not, a new symbol with the name is
created and entered into the table so that it can be found later.

Sometimes you might want to create a symbol that is guaranteed `fresh',
i.e. a symbol that did not exist previously.  You might also want to
somehow guarantee that no one else will ever unintentionally stumble
across your symbol in the future.  These properties of a symbol are
often needed when generating code during macro expansion.  When
introducing new temporary variables, you want to guarantee that they
don't conflict with variables in other people's code.

The simplest way to arrange for this is to create a new symbol but
not enter it into the global table of all symbols.  That way, no one
will ever get access to your symbol by chance.  Symbols that are not in
the table are called @dfn{uninterned}.  Of course, symbols that
@emph{are} in the table are called @dfn{interned}.

You create new uninterned symbols with the function @code{make-symbol}.
You can test whether a symbol is interned or not with
@code{symbol-interned?}.

Uninterned symbols break the rule that the name of a symbol uniquely
identifies the symbol object.  Because of this, they can not be written
out and read back in like interned symbols.  Currently, Guile has no
support for reading uninterned symbols.  Note that the function
@code{gensym} does not return uninterned symbols for this reason.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} make-symbol name
@deffnx {C Function} scm_make_symbol (name)
Return a new uninterned symbol with the name @var{name}.  The returned
symbol is guaranteed to be unique and future calls to
@code{string->symbol} will not return it.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} symbol-interned? symbol
@deffnx {C Function} scm_symbol_interned_p (symbol)
Return @code{#t} if @var{symbol} is interned, otherwise return
@code{#f}.
@end deffn

For example:

@lisp
(define foo-1 (string->symbol "foo"))
(define foo-2 (string->symbol "foo"))
(define foo-3 (make-symbol "foo"))
(define foo-4 (make-symbol "foo"))

(eq? foo-1 foo-2)
@result{} #t
; Two interned symbols with the same name are the same object,

(eq? foo-1 foo-3)
@result{} #f
; but a call to make-symbol with the same name returns a
; distinct object.

(eq? foo-3 foo-4)
@result{} #f
; A call to make-symbol always returns a new object, even for
; the same name.

foo-3
@result{} #<uninterned-symbol foo 8085290>
; Uninterned symbols print differently from interned symbols,

(symbol? foo-3)
@result{} #t
; but they are still symbols,

(symbol-interned? foo-3)
@result{} #f
; just not interned.
@end lisp


@node Keywords
@subsection Keywords
@tpindex Keywords

Keywords are self-evaluating objects with a convenient read syntax that
makes them easy to type.

Guile's keyword support conforms to R5RS, and adds a (switchable) read
syntax extension to permit keywords to begin with @code{:} as well as
@code{#:}.

@node Why Use Keywords?
@subsubsection Why Use Keywords?

Keywords are useful in contexts where a program or procedure wants to be
able to accept a large number of optional arguments without making its
interface unmanageable.

To illustrate this, consider a hypothetical @code{make-window}
procedure, which creates a new window on the screen for drawing into
using some graphical toolkit.  There are many parameters that the caller
might like to specify, but which could also be sensibly defaulted, for
example:

@itemize @bullet
@item
color depth -- Default: the color depth for the screen

@item
background color -- Default: white

@item
width -- Default: 600

@item
height -- Default: 400
@end itemize

If @code{make-window} did not use keywords, the caller would have to
pass in a value for each possible argument, remembering the correct
argument order and using a special value to indicate the default value
for that argument:

@lisp
(make-window 'default              ;; Color depth
             'default              ;; Background color
             800                   ;; Width
             100                   ;; Height
             @dots{})                  ;; More make-window arguments
@end lisp

With keywords, on the other hand, defaulted arguments are omitted, and
non-default arguments are clearly tagged by the appropriate keyword.  As
a result, the invocation becomes much clearer:

@lisp
(make-window #:width 800 #:height 100)
@end lisp

On the other hand, for a simpler procedure with few arguments, the use
of keywords would be a hindrance rather than a help.  The primitive
procedure @code{cons}, for example, would not be improved if it had to
be invoked as

@lisp
(cons #:car x #:cdr y)
@end lisp

So the decision whether to use keywords or not is purely pragmatic: use
them if they will clarify the procedure invocation at point of call.

@node Coding With Keywords
@subsubsection Coding With Keywords

If a procedure wants to support keywords, it should take a rest argument
and then use whatever means is convenient to extract keywords and their
corresponding arguments from the contents of that rest argument.

The following example illustrates the principle: the code for
@code{make-window} uses a helper procedure called
@code{get-keyword-value} to extract individual keyword arguments from
the rest argument.

@lisp
(define (get-keyword-value args keyword default)
  (let ((kv (memq keyword args)))
    (if (and kv (>= (length kv) 2))
        (cadr kv)
        default)))

(define (make-window . args)
  (let ((depth  (get-keyword-value args #:depth  screen-depth))
        (bg     (get-keyword-value args #:bg     "white"))
        (width  (get-keyword-value args #:width  800))
        (height (get-keyword-value args #:height 100))
        @dots{})
    @dots{}))
@end lisp

But you don't need to write @code{get-keyword-value}.  The @code{(ice-9
optargs)} module provides a set of powerful macros that you can use to
implement keyword-supporting procedures like this:

@lisp
(use-modules (ice-9 optargs))

(define (make-window . args)
  (let-keywords args #f ((depth  screen-depth)
                         (bg     "white")
                         (width  800)
                         (height 100))
    ...))
@end lisp

@noindent
Or, even more economically, like this:

@lisp
(use-modules (ice-9 optargs))

(define* (make-window #:key (depth  screen-depth)
                            (bg     "white")
                            (width  800)
                            (height 100))
  ...)
@end lisp

For further details on @code{let-keywords}, @code{define*} and other
facilities provided by the @code{(ice-9 optargs)} module, see
@ref{Optional Arguments}.


@node Keyword Read Syntax
@subsubsection Keyword Read Syntax

Guile, by default, only recognizes a keyword syntax that is compatible
with R5RS.  A token of the form @code{#:NAME}, where @code{NAME} has the
same syntax as a Scheme symbol (@pxref{Symbol Read Syntax}), is the
external representation of the keyword named @code{NAME}.  Keyword
objects print using this syntax as well, so values containing keyword
objects can be read back into Guile.  When used in an expression,
keywords are self-quoting objects.

If the @code{keyword} read option is set to @code{'prefix}, Guile also
recognizes the alternative read syntax @code{:NAME}.  Otherwise, tokens
of the form @code{:NAME} are read as symbols, as required by R5RS.

To enable and disable the alternative non-R5RS keyword syntax, you use
the @code{read-set!} procedure documented in @ref{User level options
interfaces} and @ref{Reader options}.

@smalllisp
(read-set! keywords 'prefix)

#:type
@result{}
#:type

:type
@result{}
#:type

(read-set! keywords #f)
