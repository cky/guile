@node Arbiters
@subsection Arbiters
@cindex arbiters

Arbiters are synchronization objects, they can be used by threads to
control access to a shared resource.  An arbiter can be locked to
indicate a resource is in use, and unlocked when done.

An arbiter is like a light-weight mutex (@pxref{Mutexes and Condition
Variables}).  It uses less memory and may be faster, but there's no
way for a thread to block waiting on an arbiter, it can only test and
get the status returned.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} make-arbiter name
@deffnx {C Function} scm_make_arbiter (name)
Return an object of type arbiter and name @var{name}. Its
state is initially unlocked.  Arbiters are a way to achieve
process synchronization.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} try-arbiter arb
@deffnx {C Function} scm_try_arbiter (arb)
@deffnx {C Function} scm_try_arbiter (arb)
If @var{arb} is unlocked, then lock it and return @code{#t}.
If @var{arb} is already locked, then do nothing and return
@code{#f}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} release-arbiter arb
@deffnx {C Function} scm_release_arbiter (arb)
If @var{arb} is locked, then unlock it and return @code{#t}.  If
@var{arb} is already unlocked, then do nothing and return @code{#f}.

Typical usage is for the thread which locked an arbiter to later
release it, but that's not required, any thread can release it.
@end deffn


@node Asyncs
@subsection Asyncs

@cindex asyncs
@cindex user asyncs
@cindex system asyncs

Asyncs are a means of deferring the excution of Scheme code until it is
safe to do so.

Guile provides two kinds of asyncs that share the basic concept but are
otherwise quite different: system asyncs and user asyncs.  System asyncs
are integrated into the core of Guile and are executed automatically
when the system is in a state to allow the execution of Scheme code.
For example, it is not possible to execute Scheme code in a POSIX signal
handler, but such a signal handler can queue a system async to be
executed in the near future, when it is safe to do so.

System asyncs can also be queued for threads other than the current one.
This way, you can cause threads to asynchronously execute arbitrary
code.

User asyncs offer a convenient means of queueing procedures for future
execution and triggering this execution.  They will not be executed
automatically.

@menu
* System asyncs::               
* User asyncs::                 
@end menu

@node System asyncs
@subsubsection System asyncs

To cause the future asynchronous execution of a procedure in a given
thread, use @code{system-async-mark}.

Automatic invocation of system asyncs can be temporarily disabled by
calling @code{call-with-blocked-asyncs}.  This function works by
temporarily increasing the @emph{async blocking level} of the current
thread while a given procedure is running.  The blocking level starts
out at zero, and whenever a safe point is reached, a blocking level
greater than zero will prevent the execution of queued asyncs.

Analogously, the procedure @code{call-with-unblocked-asyncs} will
temporarily decrease the blocking level of the current thread.  You
can use it when you want to disable asyncs by default and only allow
them temporarily.

In addition to the C versions of @code{call-with-blocked-asyncs} and
@code{call-with-unblocked-asyncs}, C code can use
@code{scm_dynwind_block_asyncs} and @code{scm_dynwind_unblock_asyncs}
inside a @dfn{dynamic context} (@pxref{Dynamic Wind}) to block or
unblock system asyncs temporarily.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} system-async-mark proc [thread]
@deffnx {C Function} scm_system_async_mark (proc)
@deffnx {C Function} scm_system_async_mark_for_thread (proc, thread)
Mark @var{proc} (a procedure with zero arguments) for future execution
in @var{thread}.  When @var{proc} has already been marked for
@var{thread} but has not been executed yet, this call has no effect.
When @var{thread} is omitted, the thread that called
@code{system-async-mark} is used.

This procedure is not safe to be called from signal handlers.  Use
@code{scm_sigaction} or @code{scm_sigaction_for_thread} to install
signal handlers.
@end deffn

@c  FIXME: The use of @deffnx for scm_c_call_with_blocked_asyncs and
@c  scm_c_call_with_unblocked_asyncs puts "void" into the function
@c  index.  Would prefer to use @deftypefnx if makeinfo allowed that,
@c  or a @deftypefn with an empty return type argument if it didn't
@c  introduce an extra space.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} call-with-blocked-asyncs proc
@deffnx {C Function} scm_call_with_blocked_asyncs (proc)
@deffnx {C Function} {void *} scm_c_call_with_blocked_asyncs (void * (*proc) (void *data), void *data)
@findex scm_c_call_with_blocked_asyncs
Call @var{proc} and block the execution of system asyncs by one level
for the current thread while it is running.  Return the value returned
by @var{proc}.  For the first two variants, call @var{proc} with no
arguments; for the third, call it with @var{data}.

with no arguments; for the third, call it with @var{data}.
@end deffn

@deftypefn {C Function} void scm_dynwind_block_asyncs ()
This function must be used inside a pair of calls to
@code{scm_dynwind_begin} and @code{scm_dynwind_end} (@pxref{Dynamic
Wind}).  During the dynwind context, asyncs are blocked by one level.
@end deftypefn

@deftypefn {C Function} void scm_dynwind_unblock_asyncs ()
This function must be used inside a pair of calls to
@code{scm_dynwind_begin} and @code{scm_dynwind_end} (@pxref{Dynamic
Wind}).  During the dynwind context, asyncs are unblocked by one
level.
@end deftypefn

@node User asyncs
@subsubsection User asyncs

A user async is a pair of a thunk (a parameterless procedure) and a
mark.  Setting the mark on a user async will cause the thunk to be
executed when the user async is passed to @code{run-asyncs}.  Setting
the mark more than once is satisfied by one execution of the thunk.

User asyncs are created with @code{async}.  They are marked with
@code{async-mark}.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} async thunk
@deffnx {C Function} scm_async (thunk)
Create a new user async for the procedure @var{thunk}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} async-mark a
@deffnx {C Function} scm_async_mark (a)
Mark the user async @var{a} for future execution.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} run-asyncs list_of_a
@deffnx {C Function} scm_run_asyncs (list_of_a)
Execute all thunks from the marked asyncs of the list @var{list_of_a}.
@end deffn

@node Continuation Barriers
@subsection Continuation Barriers

The non-local flow of control caused by continuations might sometimes
not be wanted.  You can use @code{with-continuation-barrier} etc to
errect fences that continuations can not pass.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} with-continuation-barrier proc
@deffnx {C Function} scm_with_continuation_barrier (proc)
Call @var{proc} and return its result.  Do not allow the invocation of
continuations that would leave or enter the dynamic extent of the call
to @code{with-continuation-barrier}.  Such an attempt causes an error
to be signaled.

Throws (such as errors) that are not caught from within @var{proc} are
caught by @code{with-continuation-barrier}.  In that case, a short
message is printed to the current error port and @code{#f} is returned.

Thus, @code{with-continuation-barrier} returns exactly once.
@end deffn

@deftypefn {C Function} {void *} scm_c_with_continuation_barrier (void *(*func) (void *), void *data)
Like @code{scm_with_continuation_barrier} but call @var{func} on
@var{data}.  When an error is caught, @code{NULL} is returned.
@end deftypefn

@node Threads
@subsection Threads
@cindex threads
@cindex Guile threads
@cindex POSIX threads

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} all-threads
@deffnx {C Function} scm_all_threads ()
Return a list of all threads.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} current-thread
@deffnx {C Function} scm_current_thread ()
Return the thread that called this function.
@end deffn

@c begin (texi-doc-string "guile" "call-with-new-thread")
@deffn {Scheme Procedure} call-with-new-thread thunk [handler]
Call @code{thunk} in a new thread and with a new dynamic state,
returning the new thread.  The procedure @var{thunk} is called via
@code{with-continuation-barrier}.

When @var{handler} is specified, then @var{thunk} is called from
within a @code{catch} with tag @code{#t} that has @var{handler} as its
handler.  This catch is established inside the continuation barrier.

Once @var{thunk} or @var{handler} returns, the return value is made
the @emph{exit value} of the thread and the thread is terminated.
@end deffn

@deftypefn {C Function} SCM scm_spawn_thread (scm_t_catch_body body, void *body_data, scm_t_catch_handler handler, void *handler_data)
Call @var{body} in a new thread, passing it @var{body_data}, returning
the new thread.  The function @var{body} is called via
@code{scm_c_with_continuation_barrier}.

When @var{handler} is non-@code{NULL}, @var{body} is called via
@code{scm_internal_catch} with tag @code{SCM_BOOL_T} that has
@var{handler} and @var{handler_data} as the handler and its data.  This
catch is established inside the continuation barrier.

Once @var{body} or @var{handler} returns, the return value is made the
@emph{exit value} of the thread and the thread is terminated.
@end deftypefn

@c begin (texi-doc-string "guile" "join-thread")
@deffn {Scheme Procedure} join-thread thread
Wait for @var{thread} to terminate and return its exit value.  Threads
that have not been created with @code{call-with-new-thread} or
@code{scm_spawn_thread} have an exit value of @code{#f}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} thread-exited? thread
@deffnx {C Function} scm_thread_exited_p (thread)
Return @code{#t} iff @var{thread} has exited.
@end deffn

@c begin (texi-doc-string "guile" "yield")
@deffn {Scheme Procedure} yield
If one or more threads are waiting to execute, calling yield forces an
immediate context switch to one of them. Otherwise, yield has no effect.
@end deffn

Higher level thread procedures are available by loading the
@code{(ice-9 threads)} module.  These provide standardized
thread creation.

@deffn macro make-thread proc [args@dots{}]
Apply @var{proc} to @var{args} in a new thread formed by
@code{call-with-new-thread} using a default error handler that display
the error to the current error port.  The @var{args@dots{}}
expressions are evaluated in the new thread.
@end deffn

@deffn macro begin-thread first [rest@dots{}]
Evaluate forms @var{first} and @var{rest} in a new thread formed by
@code{call-with-new-thread} using a default error handler that display
the error to the current error port.
@end deffn

@node Mutexes and Condition Variables
@subsection Mutexes and Condition Variables
@cindex mutex
@cindex condition variable

A mutex is a thread synchronization object, it can be used by threads
to control access to a shared resource.  A mutex can be locked to
indicate a resource is in use, and other threads can then block on the
mutex to wait for the resource (or can just test and do something else
if not available).  ``Mutex'' is short for ``mutual exclusion''.

There are two types of mutexes in Guile, ``standard'' and
``recursive''.  They're created by @code{make-mutex} and
@code{make-recursive-mutex} respectively, the operation functions are
then common to both.

Note that for both types of mutex there's no protection against a
``deadly embrace''.  For instance if one thread has locked mutex A and
is waiting on mutex B, but another thread owns B and is waiting on A,
then an endless wait will occur (in the current implementation).
Acquiring requisite mutexes in a fixed order (like always A before B)
in all threads is one way to avoid such problems.

@sp 1
@deffn {Scheme Procedure} make-mutex
@deffnx {C Function} scm_make_mutex ()
Return a new standard mutex.  It is initially unlocked.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} make-recursive-mutex
@deffnx {C Function} scm_make_recursive_mutex ()
Create a new recursive mutex.  It is initialloy unlocked.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} lock-mutex mutex
@deffnx {C Function} scm_lock_mutex (mutex)
Lock @var{mutex}.  If the mutex is already locked by another thread
then block and return only when @var{mutex} has been acquired.

For standard mutexes (@code{make-mutex}), and error is signalled if
the thread has itself already locked @var{mutex}.

For a recursive mutex (@code{make-recursive-mutex}), if the thread has
itself already locked @var{mutex}, then a further @code{lock-mutex}
call increments the lock count.  An additional @code{unlock-mutex}
will be required to finally release.

When a system async (@pxref{System asyncs}) is activated for a thread
blocked in @code{lock-mutex}, the wait is interrupted and the async is
executed.  When the async returns, the wait resumes.
@end deffn

@deftypefn {C Function} void scm_dynwind_lock_mutex (SCM mutex)
Arrange for @var{mutex} to be locked whenever the current dynwind
context is entered and to be unlocked when it is exited.
@end deftypefn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} try-mutex mx
@deffnx {C Function} scm_try_mutex (mx)
Try to lock @var{mutex} as per @code{lock-mutex}.  If @var{mutex} can
be acquired immediately then this is done and the return is @code{#t}.
If @var{mutex} is locked by some other thread then nothing is done and
the return is @code{#f}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} unlock-mutex mutex
@deffnx {C Function} scm_unlock_mutex (mutex)
Unlock @var{mutex}.  An error is signalled if @var{mutex} is not
locked by the calling thread.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} make-condition-variable
@deffnx {C Function} scm_make_condition_variable ()
Return a new condition variable.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} wait-condition-variable condvar mutex [time]
@deffnx {C Function} scm_wait_condition_variable (condvar, mutex, time)
Wait until @var{condvar} has been signalled.  While waiting,
@var{mutex} is atomically unlocked (as with @code{unlock-mutex}) and
is locked again when this function returns.  When @var{time} is given,
it specifies a point in time where the waiting should be aborted.  It
can be either a integer as returned by @code{current-time} or a pair
as returned by @code{gettimeofday}.  When the waiting is aborted,
@code{#f} is returned.  When the condition variable has in fact been
signalled, @code{#t} is returned.  The mutex is re-locked in any case
before @code{wait-condition-variable} returns.

When a system async is activated for a thread that is blocked in a
call to @code{wait-condition-variable}, the waiting is interrupted,
the mutex is locked, and the async is executed.  When the async
returns, the mutex is unlocked again and the waiting is resumed.  When
the thread block while re-acquiring the mutex, execution of asyncs is
blocked.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} signal-condition-variable condvar
@deffnx {C Function} scm_signal_condition_variable (condvar)
Wake up one thread that is waiting for @var{condvar}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} broadcast-condition-variable condvar
@deffnx {C Function} scm_broadcast_condition_variable (condvar)
Wake up all threads that are waiting for @var{condvar}.
@end deffn

@sp 1
The following are higher level operations on mutexes.  These are
available from

@example
(use-modules (ice-9 threads))
@end example

@deffn macro with-mutex mutex [body@dots{}]
Lock @var{mutex}, evaluate the @var{body} forms, then unlock
@var{mutex}.  The return value is the return from the last @var{body}
form.

The lock, body and unlock form the branches of a @code{dynamic-wind}
(@pxref{Dynamic Wind}), so @var{mutex} is automatically unlocked if an
error or new continuation exits @var{body}, and is re-locked if
@var{body} is re-entered by a captured continuation.
@end deffn

@deffn macro monitor body@dots{}
Evaluate the @var{body} forms, with a mutex locked so only one thread
can execute that code at any one time.  The return value is the return
from the last @var{body} form.

Each @code{monitor} form has its own private mutex and the locking and
evaluation is as per @code{with-mutex} above.  A standard mutex
(@code{make-mutex}) is used, which means @var{body} must not
recursively re-enter the @code{monitor} form.

The term ``monitor'' comes from operating system theory, where it
means a particular bit of code managing access to some resource and
which only ever executes on behalf of one process at any one time.
@end deffn


@node Blocking
@subsection Blocking in Guile Mode

A thread must not block outside of a libguile function while it is in
guile mode.  The following functions can be used to temporily leave
guile mode or to perform some common blocking operations in a supported
way.

@deftypefn {C Function} {void *} scm_without_guile (void *(*func) (void *), void *data)
Leave guile mode, call @var{func} on @var{data}, enter guile mode and
return the result of calling @var{func}.

While a thread has left guile mode, it must not call any libguile
functions except @code{scm_with_guile} or @code{scm_without_guile} and
must not use any libguile macros.  Also, local variables of type
@code{SCM} that are allocated while not in guile mode are not
protected from the garbage collector.

When used from non-guile mode, calling @code{scm_without_guile} is
still allowed: it simply calls @var{func}.  In that way, you can leave
guile mode without having to know whether the current thread is in
guile mode or not.
@end deftypefn

@deftypefn {C Function} int scm_pthread_mutex_lock (pthread_mutex_t *mutex)
Like @code{pthread_mutex_lock}, but leaves guile mode while waiting for
the mutex.
@end deftypefn

@deftypefn  {C Function} int scm_pthread_cond_wait (pthread_cond_t *cond, pthread_mutex_t *mutex)
@deftypefnx {C Function} int scm_pthread_cond_timedwait (pthread_cond_t *cond, pthread_mutex_t *mutex, struct timespec *abstime)
Like @code{pthread_cond_wait} and @code{pthread_cond_timedwait}, but
leaves guile mode while waiting for the condition variable.
@end deftypefn

@deftypefn {C Function} int scm_std_select (int nfds, fd_set *readfds, fd_set *writefds, fd_set *exceptfds, struct timeval *timeout)
Like @code{select} but leaves guile mode while waiting.  Also, the
delivery of a system async causes this function to be interrupted with
error code @code{EINTR}.
@end deftypefn

@deftypefn {C Function} {unsigned int} scm_std_sleep ({unsigned int} seconds)
Like @code{sleep}, but leaves guile mode while sleeping.  Also, the
delivery of a system async causes this function to be interrupted.
@end deftypefn

@deftypefn {C Function} {unsigned long} scm_std_usleep ({unsigned long} usecs)
Like @code{usleep}, but leaves guile mode while sleeping.  Also, the
delivery of a system async causes this function to be interrupted.
@end deftypefn


@node Critical Sections
@subsection Critical Sections

@deffn  {C Macro} SCM_CRITICAL_SECTION_START
@deffnx {C Macro} SCM_CRITICAL_SECTION_END
These two macros can be used to delimit a critical section.
Syntactically, they are both statements and need to be followed
immediately by a semicolon.

Executing @code{SCM_CRITICAL_SECTION_START} will lock a recursive
mutex and block the executing of system asyncs.  Executing
@code{SCM_CRITICAL_SECTION_END} will unblock the execution of system
asyncs and unlock the mutex.  Thus, the code that executes between
these two macros can only be executed in one thread at any one time
and no system asyncs will run.  However, because the mutex is a
recursive one, the code might still be reentered by the same thread.
You must either allow for this or avoid it, both by careful coding.

On the other hand, critical sections delimited with these macros can
be nested since the mutex is recursive.

You must make sure that for each @code{SCM_CRITICAL_SECTION_START},
the corresponding @code{SCM_CRITICAL_SECTION_END} is always executed.
This means that no non-local exit (such as a signalled error) might
happen, for example.
@end deffn

@deftypefn {C Function} void scm_dynwind_critical_section (SCM mutex)
Call @code{scm_dynwind_lock_mutex} on @var{mutex} and call
@code{scm_dynwind_block_asyncs}.  When @var{mutex} is false, a recursive
mutex provided by Guile is used instead.

The effect of a call to @code{scm_dynwind_critical_section} is that
the current dynwind context (@pxref{Dynamic Wind}) turns into a
critical section.  Because of the locked mutex, no second thread can
enter it concurrently and because of the blocked asyncs, no system
async can reenter it from the current thread.

When the current thread reenters the critical section anyway, the kind
of @var{mutex} determines what happens: When @var{mutex} is recursive,
the reentry is allowed.  When it is a normal mutex, an error is
signalled.
@end deftypefn


@node Fluids and Dynamic States
@subsection Fluids and Dynamic States

@cindex fluids

A @emph{fluid} is an object that can store one value per @emph{dynamic
state}.  Each thread has a current dynamic state, and when accessing a
fluid, this current dynamic state is used to provide the actual value.
In this way, fluids can be used for thread local storage, but they are
in fact more flexible: dynamic states are objects of their own and can
be made current for more than one thread at the same time, or only be
made current temporarily, for example.

Fluids can also be used to simulate the desirable effects of
dynamically scoped variables.  Dynamically scoped variables are useful
when you want to set a variable to a value during some dynamic extent
in the execution of your program and have them revert to their
original value when the control flow is outside of this dynamic
extent.  See the description of @code{with-fluids} below for details.

New fluids are created with @code{make-fluid} and @code{fluid?} is
used for testing whether an object is actually a fluid.  The values
stored in a fluid can be accessed with @code{fluid-ref} and
@code{fluid-set!}.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} make-fluid
@deffnx {C Function} scm_make_fluid ()
Return a newly created fluid.
Fluids are objects that can hold one
value per dynamic state.  That is, modifications to this value are
only visible to code that executes with the same dynamic state as
the modifying code.  When a new dynamic state is constructed, it
inherits the values from its parent.  Because each thread normally executes
with its own dynamic state, you can use fluids for thread local storage.
@end deffn

@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Macro} with-fluids ((fluid value) ...) body...
Execute @var{body...} while each @var{fluid} is set to the

The function @code{scm_c_with_fluids} is like @code{scm_with_fluids}
except that it takes a C function to call instead of a Scheme thunk.

The function @code{scm_c_with_fluid} is similar but only allows one

More precisely, the value of the fluid is swapped with a `backup'
value whenever the dynwind context is entered or left.  The backup
value is initialized with the @var{val} argument.

@c @node Futures
@c @subsection Futures
@c @cindex futures

@c -- Futures are disabled for the time being, see futures.h for an
@c -- explanation.

@c Futures are a convenient way to run a calculation in a new thread, and
@c only wait for the result when it's actually needed.

@c Futures are similar to promises (@pxref{Delayed Evaluation}), in that
@c they allow mainline code to continue immediately.  But @code{delay}
@c doesn't evaluate at all until forced, whereas @code{future} starts
@c immediately in a new thread.

@c @deffn {syntax} future expr
@c Begin evaluating @var{expr} in a new thread, and return a ``future''
@c object representing the calculation.
@c @end deffn

@c @deffn {Scheme Procedure} make-future thunk
@c @deffnx {C Function} scm_make_future (thunk)
@c Begin evaluating the call @code{(@var{thunk})} in a new thread, and
@c return a ``future'' object representing the calculation.
@c @end deffn

@c @deffn {Scheme Procedure} future-ref f
@c @deffnx {C Function} scm_future_ref (f)
@c Return the value computed by the future @var{f}.  If @var{f} has not
@c yet finished executing then wait for it to do so.
@c @end deffn


@node Parallel Forms
@subsection Parallel forms
@cindex parallel forms

The functions described in this section are available from

@example
(use-modules (ice-9 threads))
@end example

@deffn syntax parallel expr1 @dots{} exprN
Evaluate each @var{expr} expression in parallel, each in its own thread.
Return the results as a set of @var{N} multiple values
(@pxref{Multiple Values}).
@end deffn

@deffn syntax letpar ((var1 expr1) @dots{} (varN exprN)) body@dots{}
Evaluate each @var{expr} in parallel, each in its own thread, then bind
the results to the corresponding @var{var} variables and evaluate
@var{body}.

@code{letpar} is like @code{let} (@pxref{Local Bindings}), but all the
expressions for the bindings are evaluated in parallel.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} par-map proc lst1 @dots{} lstN
@deffnx {Scheme Procedure} par-for-each proc lst1 @dots{} lstN
Call @var{proc} on the elements of the given lists.  @code{par-map}
returns a list comprising the return values from @var{proc}.
@code{par-for-each} returns an unspecified value, but waits for all
calls to complete.

The @var{proc} calls are @code{(@var{proc} @var{elem1} @dots{}
@var{elemN})}, where each @var{elem} is from the corresponding
@var{lst}.  Each @var{lst} must be the same length.  The calls are
made in parallel, each in its own thread.

These functions are like @code{map} and @code{for-each} (@pxref{List
Mapping}), but make their @var{proc} calls in parallel.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} n-par-map n proc lst1 @dots{} lstN
@deffnx {Scheme Procedure} n-par-for-each n proc lst1 @dots{} lstN
Call @var{proc} on the elements of the given lists, in the same way as
@code{par-map} and @code{par-for-each} above, but use no more than
@var{n} threads at any one time.  The order in which calls are
initiated within that threads limit is unspecified.

These functions are good for controlling resource consumption if
@var{proc} calls might be costly, or if there are many to be made.  On
a dual-CPU system for instance @math{@var{n}=4} might be enough to
keep the CPUs utilized, and not consume too much memory.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} n-for-each-par-map n sproc pproc lst1 @dots{} lstN
Apply @var{pproc} to the elements of the given lists, and apply
@var{sproc} to each result returned by @var{pproc}.  The final return
value is unspecified, but all calls will have been completed before
returning.

The calls made are @code{(@var{sproc} (@var{pproc} @var{elem1} @dots{}
@var{elemN}))}, where each @var{elem} is from the corresponding
@var{lst}.  Each @var{lst} must have the same number of elements.

The @var{pproc} calls are made in parallel, in separate threads.  No more
than @var{n} threads are used at any one time.  The order in which
@var{pproc} calls are initiated within that limit is unspecified.

The @var{sproc} calls are made serially, in list element order, one at
a time.  @var{pproc} calls on later elements may execute in parallel
with the @var{sproc} calls.  Exactly which thread makes each
@var{sproc} call is unspecified.

This function is designed for individual calculations that can be done
in parallel, but with results needing to be handled serially, for
instance to write them to a file.  The @var{n} limit on threads
controls system resource usage when there are many calculations or
when they might be costly.

It will be seen that @code{n-for-each-par-map} is like a combination
of @code{n-par-map} and @code{for-each},

@example
(for-each sproc (n-par-map n pproc lst1 ... lstN))
@end example

@noindent
But the actual implementation is more efficient since each @var{sproc}
call, in turn, can be initiated once the relevant @var{pproc} call has
completed, it doesn't need to wait for all to finish.
