@node Guile Scheme
@section Guile's Implementation of Scheme

Guile's core language is Scheme, which is specified and described in the
series of reports known as @dfn{RnRS}.  @dfn{RnRS} is shorthand for the
@iftex
@dfn{Revised$^n$ Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme}.
@end iftex
@ifnottex
@dfn{Revised^n Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme}.
@end ifnottex
Guile complies fully with R5RS (@pxref{Top,
,Introduction,r5rs,R5RS}), and implements some aspects of R6RS.

Guile also has many extensions that go beyond these reports.  Some of
the areas where Guile extends R5RS are:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Guile's interactive documentation system

@item
Guile's support for POSIX-compliant network programming

@item
GOOPS -- Guile's framework for object oriented programming.
