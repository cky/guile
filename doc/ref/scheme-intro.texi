@chapter Introduction to Guile Scheme

Guile's core language is Scheme, which is specified and described in the
series of reports known as @dfn{RnRS}.  @dfn{RnRS} is shorthand for the
@iftex
@dfn{Revised$^n$ Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme}.
@end iftex
@ifnottex
@dfn{Revised^n Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme}.
@end ifnottex
The current latest revision of RnRS is version 5
(@pxref{Top,R5RS,,r5rs}), and Guile 1.4 is fully compliant with the
Scheme specification in this revision.

But Guile, like most Scheme implementations, also goes beyond R5RS in
many ways, because R5RS does not give specifications (or even
recommendations) regarding many issues that are important in practical
programming.  Some of the areas where Guile extends R5RS are:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Guile's interactive documentation system

@item
Guile's support for POSIX-compliant network programming

@item
GOOPS -- Guile's framework for object oriented programming.

This part of the reference manual documents all of Guile's core
Scheme-level language and features in functionally-related groups.
Where a particular section of the manual includes both R5RS-compliant
parts and Guile-specific extensions, the text indicates which parts of
the documentation describe R5RS behaviour and which parts describe Guile
extensions.

For a quick way of identifying the parts of Guile that implement
R5RS-compliant features, see the R5RS index: @ref{R5RS Index}.
