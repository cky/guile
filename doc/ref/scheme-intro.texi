@chapter Guile's Implementation of Scheme

Guile's core language is Scheme, which is specified and described in the
series of reports known as @dfn{RnRS}.  @dfn{RnRS} is shorthand for the
@iftex
@dfn{Revised$^n$ Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme}.
@end iftex
@ifnottex
@dfn{Revised^n Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme}.
@end ifnottex
The current latest revision of RnRS is version 5
(@pxref{Top,R5RS,,r5rs}), and Guile 1.4 is fully compliant with the
Scheme specification in this revision.

But Guile, like most Scheme implementations, also goes beyond R5RS in
many ways, because R5RS does not give specifications (or even
recommendations) regarding many issues that are important in practical
programming.  Some of the areas where Guile extends R5RS are:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Guile's interactive documentation system

@item
Guile's support for POSIX-compliant network programming

@item
GOOPS -- Guile's framework for object oriented programming.
