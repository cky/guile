## Commentary:

## This fragment defines two variables: workbook and mscripts.
## It can be included in any Makefile.am by adding the line:
##   include $(top_srcdir)/am/maintainer-dirs
## See $(workbook)/build/maintainer-dirs.text for more info.

## Code:

workbook	= $(top_srcdir_absolute)/../workbook
mscripts	= $(top_srcdir_absolute)/../scripts

## am/maintainer-dirs ends here
