This is not a Guile release; it is a source tree retrieved via
anonymous CVS or as a nightly snapshot at some random time after the
Guile 1.4 release.

This is version 1.4.1 of Guile, Project GNU's extension language
library.  Guile is an interpreter for Scheme, packaged as a library
that you can link into your applications to give them their own
scripting language.  Guile will eventually support other languages as
well, giving users of Guile-based applications a choice of languages.

Please send bug reports to bug-guile@gnu.org.

Guile Documentation ==================================================

The doc directory contains a few articles on specific topics and some
examples, including data-rep.texi which describes the internal
representation of data types in Guile.  The example-smob directory
contains example source code for the "Defining New Types (Smobs)" chapter.

The incomplete Guile reference manual is available at

  ftp://ftp.red-bean.com/pub/guile/snapshots/guile-doc-snap.tar.gz

Neil Jerram is working on the new reference manual, which will be
distributed with guile-core.  The new manual will be synchronized with
the docstrings in the sources.  Until then, please be aware that the
docstrings are likely to be more up-to-date than the old reference
manual (use `(help)' or see libguile/guile-procedures.txt which is
generated by the build process).

The Guile WWW page is at

  http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/guile.html

It contains a link to the Guile FAQ.

Guile License ==================================================

The license of Guile consists of the GNU GPL plus a special statement

 As a special exception, the Free Software Foundation gives permission
 for additional uses of the text contained in its release of GUILE.

 The exception is that, if you link the GUILE library with other files
 to produce an executable, this does not by itself cause the
 resulting executable to be covered by the GNU General Public License.
 Your use of that executable is in no way restricted on account of
 linking the GUILE library code into it.

 This exception does not however invalidate any other reasons why
 the executable file might be covered by the GNU General Public License.

 This exception applies only to the code released by the
 Free Software Foundation under the name GUILE.  If you copy
 code from other Free Software Foundation releases into a copy of
 GUILE, as the General Public License permits, the exception does
 not apply to the code that you add in this way.  To avoid misleading
 anyone as to the status of such modified files, you must delete
 this exception notice from them.

 If you write modifications of your own for GUILE, it is your choice
 whether to permit this exception to apply to your modifications.
 If you do not wish that, delete this exception notice.

About This Distribution ==============================================

Interesting files include:

- INSTALL, which contains instructions on building and installing Guile.
- NEWS, which describes user-visible changes since the last release of Guile.

Files are usually installed according to the prefix specified to
configure, /usr/local by default.  Building and installing gives you:

Executables, in ${prefix}/bin:

guile --- a stand-alone interpreter for Guile.  With no arguments, this
	is a simple interactive Scheme interpreter.  It can also be used
	as an interpreter for script files; see the NEWS file for details.
guile-config --- a Guile script which provides the information necessary
	to link your programs against the Guile library.
guile-snarf --- a script to parse declarations in your C code for 
	Scheme-visible C functions, Scheme objects to be used by C code,
	etc.

Libraries, in ${prefix}/lib.  Depending on the platform and options
        given to configure, you may get shared libraries in addition
	to or instead of these static libraries:
	
libguile.a --- an object library containing the Guile interpreter,
	You can use Guile in your own programs by linking against this.
libqthreads.a --- an object library containing the QuickThreads
	primitives.  If you enabled thread support when you configured
	Guile, you will need to link your code against this too.
libguilereadline.a --- an object library containing glue code for the
        GNU readline library.  See NEWS for instructions on how to enable
	readline for your personal use.

Header files, in ${prefix}/include:

libguile.h, guile/gh.h, libguile/*.h --- for libguile.
guile-readline/readline.h --- for guile-readline.

Support files, in ${prefix}/share/guile/<version>:

ice-9/* --- run-time support for Guile: the module system,
	read-eval-print loop, some R4RS code and other infrastructure.

Automake macros, in ${prefix}/share/aclocal:

guile.m4

Documentation in Info format, in ${prefix}/info:

data-rep.info --- an essay on how to write C code that works with
	Guile Scheme values.

The Guile source tree is laid out as follows:

libguile:
	The Guile Scheme interpreter --- both the object library
	for you to link with your programs, and the executable you can run.
ice-9:  Guile's module system, initialization code, and other infrastructure.
guile-config:
	Source for the guile-config script.
qt: 	A cooperative threads package from the University of Washington,
	which Guile can use.  If you configure Guile with the
        --with-threads flag, you will need to link against the -lqt
        library, found in this directory.  Qt is under a separate
        copyright; see `qt/README' for more details.
guile-readline:
        The glue code for using GNU readline with Guile.  This
        will be build when configure can find a recent enough readline
        library on your system.
doc:	Documentation (see above).

Anonymous CVS Access and FTP snapshots ===============================

We make the developers' working Guile sources available via anonymous
CVS, and by nightly snapshots, accessible via FTP.  See the files
`ANON-CVS' and `SNAPSHOTS' for details.

If you would like to receive mail when people commit changes to the
Guile CVS repository, you can subscribe to guile-cvs@gnu.org by the
Mailman mailing list interface at

  <http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/guile-cvs>


Obtaining Guile ======================================================

The latest official Guile release is available via anonymous FTP from

ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/guile/guile-1.4.tar.gz

The mailing list `guile-user@gnu.org' carries discussions, questions,
and often answers, about Guile.  To subscribe, use the Mailman mailing
list interface at <http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/guile-user>
Of course, please send bug reports (and fixes!) to bug-guile@gnu.org.
