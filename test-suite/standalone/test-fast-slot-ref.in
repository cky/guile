# Test for %fast-slot-ref, which was previously implemented such that
# an out-of-range slot index could escape being properly detected, and
# could then cause a segmentation fault.
#
# Prior to the change in this commit to goops.c, the following
# sequence reliably causes a segmentation fault on my GNU/Linux when
# executing the (%fast-slot-ref i 3) line.  For reasons as yet
# unknown, it does not cause a segmentation fault if the same code is
# loaded as a script; that is why we run it here using "guile -q <<EOF".
