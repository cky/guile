;;;; Usage: [guile -e main -s] guile-test [OPTIONS] [TEST ...]
;;;;
;;;; Run tests from the Guile test suite.  Report failures and
;;;; unexpected passes to the standard output, along with a summary of
;;;; all the results.  Record each reported test outcome in the log
;;;; file, `guile.log'.  The exit status is #f if any of the tests
;;;; fail or pass unexpectedly.
;;;;
;;;; Normally, guile-test scans the test directory, and executes all
;;;; files whose names end in `.test'.  (It assumes they contain
;;;; Scheme code.)  However, you can have it execute specific tests by
;;;; listing their filenames on the command line.
;;;;
;;;; The option `--test-suite' can be given to specify the test
;;;; directory.  If no such option is given, the test directory is
;;;; taken from the environment variable TEST_SUITE_DIR (if defined),
;;;; otherwise a default directory that is hardcoded in this file is
;;;; used (see "Installation" below).
;;;;
;;;; If present, the `--log-file LOG' option tells `guile-test' to put
;;;; the log output in a file named LOG.
;;;;
;;;; If present, the `--debug' option will enable a debugging mode.
;;;;
;;;; If present, the `--flag-unresolved' option will cause guile-test
;;;; to exit with failure status if any tests are UNRESOLVED.
;;;;
;;;;
;;;; Installation:
;;;;
;;;; If you change the #! line at the top of this script to point at
;;;; the Guile interpreter you want to test, you can call this script
;;;; as an executable instead of having to pass it as a parameter to
;;;; guile via "guile -e main -s guile-test".  Further, you can edit
;;;; the definition of default-test-suite to point to the parent
;;;; directory of the `tests' tree, which makes it unnecessary to set
;;;; the environment variable `TEST_SUITE_DIR'.
;;;;
;;;;
;;;; Shortcomings:
;;;;
;;;; At the moment, due to a simple-minded implementation, test files
;;;; must live in the test directory, and you must specify their names
;;;; relative to the top of the test directory.  If you want to send
;;;; me a patch that fixes this, but still leaves sane test names in
;;;; the log file, that would be great.  At the moment, all the tests
;;;; I care about are in the test directory, though.
;;;;
;;;; It would be nice if you could specify the Guile interpreter you
;;;; want to test on the command line.  As it stands, if you want to
;;;; change which Guile interpreter you're testing, you need to edit
;;;; the #! line at the top of this file, which is stupid.
