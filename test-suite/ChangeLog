	test, dups are allowed in `let*' and are now expected to pass.

2001-03-05  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* lib.scm (run-test-exception):  Preserve the original error's
	stack for re-throwing.

2001-03-04  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	appropriate tests here.  Expect them to pass.
	("empty parentheses"): Expect to pass, bug has been fixed.

	* tests/alist.test: Use "'()" instead of "()" in all places
	where the empty list is meant.

2001-03-01  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* lib.scm (exception:unbound-var, exception:wrong-num-args):  New
	exported constants.

	* tests/r4rs.test:  Make sure that no bindings for x and y exist
	after the file is loaded.

	* tests/syntax.test:  New file.

	* tests/exceptions.test, tests/syntax.test, tests/eval.test:
	Moved the test cases that are related to guile's syntactic forms
	from tests/exceptions.test to tests/syntax.test.  Moved tests
	related to evaluation and application to tests/eval.test.

	* tests/exceptions.test:  Added some test cases that check guile's
	exception handling.

2001-03-01  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* tests/exceptions.test, tests/numbers.test:  Moved the number
	related test cases from tests/exceptions.test to
	tests/numbers.test.

	* tests/numbers.test:  Added a test case.

2001-03-01  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* tests/symbols.test:  New file.

	(exception:immutable-string):  New constant.  Currently, this is a
	dummy since guile does not have immutable strings.

	* tests/exceptions.test, tests/strings.test, tests/symbols.test:
	Moved the string related test cases from tests/exceptions.test to
	tests/strings.test and the symbol related test cases to
	tests/symbols.test.

	* tests/strings.test:  Copyright notice updated.  Added a couple
	of test cases.

	(exception:immutable-string):  New constant.  Currently, this is a
	dummy since guile does not have immutable strings.

	* tests/exceptions.test:  Use expect-fail-exception to indicate
	test cases where exceptions should occur, but don't.

	* lib.scm (signals-error?, signals-error?*):  Removed.

2001-02-28  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* lib.scm:  Added comment about new convenience functions/macros
	to test for exceptions.

	(exception:out-of-range, exception:wrong-type-arg):  New exported
	constants.

	(run-test-exception):  New function.

	(pass-if-exception, expect-fail-exception):  New exported macros.

	catch-error-returning-false), tests/weaks.test
	(catch-error-returning-true, pass-if-not,
	catch-error-returning-false):  Removed.  The macro pass-if-not was
	not used.  The macro catch-error-returning-false is unnecessary
	since exceptions are caught by the test-suite anyway.  The
	functionality of catch-error-returning-true is provided by the new
	convenience macro pass-if-exception.

	* tests/hooks.test (exception:wrong-num-hook-args):  New constant.
	Maybe a standard wrong-num-arg exception should be thrown instead
	of a misc-error?

	* tests/reader.test (try-to-read):  Replaced by read-string.

	(read-string):  New function.

	* tests/alist.test, tests/environments.test, tests/eval.test,
	tests/hooks.test, tests/list.test, tests/ports.test,
	tests/reader.test, tests/strings.test, tests/weaks.test:  Replace
	tests for exceptions with the new convenience macros.

2001-02-28  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* tests/alist.test:  Remove redundant test name prefix.

2001-02-28  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* lib.scm (pass-if):  Tests shall return a boolean value.

	* tests/bit-operations.test (documented?), tests/common-list.test
	(documented?), tests/environments.test (documented?),
	tests/eval.test (documented?), tests/gc.test (documented?),
	tests/numbers.test (documented?), tests/guardians.test,
	tests/hooks.test, tests/interp.test, tests/weaks.test:  Make sure

	(syntax lambda cond-arrow-proc): Renamed from (lambda cond-arrow-proc).
	(syntax reading): New section.
	(syntax let*): New section.
	(syntax letrec): New section.
	(syntax set!): New section.
	(syntax misc): New section.

	(bindings let): New section.
	(bindings let*): New section.
	(bindings letrec): New section.

	* tests/exceptions.test: New file.

2001-02-08  Marius Vollmer  <marius.vollmer@uni-dortmund.de>

	* guile-test: Use (ice-9 and-let-star) instead of (ice-9
	and-let*).

2001-01-26  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	This patch fixes things that I have broken with the last one :-(

	* guile-test (test-suite):  New variable.

	(data-file-name):  New function.  Has the same purpose as the
	former function data-file from lib.scm.  Moved here in order to
	have all file name handling at the same place.  In contrast to the
	former 'data-file function, it is not checked whether a file
	exists.  This allows to use this function also for file names of
	files that are still to be created.

	(test-file-name):  Use the global 'test-suite variable.

	(main):  Initialize 'test-suite instead of a local variable.

	* lib.scm:  Don't import paths any more.

	(data-file):  Removed.  Resurrected with a sligtly different
	functionality as 'data-file-name' in guile-test.

	* r4rs.scm:  For all references to temporary file, make use of
	data-file-name.

2001-01-26  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	The following patch was sent by Thien-Thi Nguyen and a little bit
	modified by me.

	* guile-test:  Usage and installation comments improved.  Added
	support for --test-suite and --debug command line options.

	(default-test-suite):  Added to allow for simplified
	configurability.  No need to load the paths file any more.

	(enable-debug-mode):  New function.  Will be called when the
	--debug command line option is given.

	(test-root):  Removed.  The test directory has to be fully given.
	This allows for arbitrarily named test directories.

	(test-file-name, enumerate-tets):  Take the test directory as a
	paramter instead of using the global variable 'test-root'.

	(main):  Handle the new command line options.  Return an exit code
	depending on whether all tests came out as expected.

	* README:  Updated.

	* paths.scm:  Removed.

2001-01-24  Gary Houston  <ghouston@arglist.com>

	* tests/ports.test: include (ice-9 rdelim) module.

	and friends need fixing.

2000-09-12  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* tests/environments.test:  For tests that rely on garbage
	collection, conservative scanning can be a problem.  Add a comment
	for these tests and make them turn out unresolved if things don't
	work as expected.

2000-09-05  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* tests/environments.test:  Finished and cleaned up the tests for
	the leaf environments.  Added a complete set of testcases for the
	leaf environment based eval environments.  Started with the tests
	for the import environments.

2000-08-25  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* tests/environments.test:  Added.

2000-08-21  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* tests/list.test, tests/numbers.test:  Added.

2000-05-08  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* guile-test:  Eliminate use of catch-test-errors.

	* lib.scm:  Adopted a couple of nice ideas from Greg.

	(pass, fail, expect-failure, expect-failure-if,
	expect-failure-if*, catch-test-errors, catch-test-errors*,
	expected-failure-fluid, pessimist?):  Removed.

	(run-test, expect-fail, result-tags, important-result-tags):
	Added.

	(report, make-count-reporter, print-counts, make-log-reporter,
	full-reporter, user-reporter):  Reporters take two mandatory
	arguments and make use of the tag descriptions in result-tags and
	important-result-tags.

	tests/weaks.test:  Don't use catch-test-errors and
	expect-failure-if.

	* mambo.test:  Removed dummy file.

2000-03-31  Gary Houston  <ghouston@arglist.com>

	* tests/ports.test (non-blocking-I/O): a couple more details:
	a) combine the O_NONBLOCK flag with the default flags instead
	of replacing them.  b) check EWOULDBLOCK as well as EAGAIN.

2000-03-22  Jim Blandy  <jimb@savonarola.red-bean.com>

	* lib.scm: Doc fixes.

Sun Jan 16 14:01:51 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* paths.scm: Assume that ~/guile-core/test-suite is the location
	of the test suite now.

	* tests/version.test: Added -- version.c had 0% coverage before,
	now at 100%.

	* tests/chars.test: Added -- needed test of char-is-both?.

1999-12-22  Greg Harvey <Greg.Harvey@thezone.net>

	* tests/c-api.test: Refine the list of files that are checked in
	the seek-offset-test.  Was just using files that end in "c", but

	an input string and seeking an output string.

	that ftell doesn't discard unread chars.

1999-10-18  Gary Houston  <ghouston@freewire.co.uk>

	* tests/ports.test: add seek/tell tests for unidirectional ports.

	* tests/ports.test: Check that our input functions cope when
	current-input-port is closed.

	* tests/regexp.test: Check regexp-substitute/global when there are
	no matches.  (Duh.)

1999-09-15  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@thalamus.nada.kth.se>

	fports with seeking.

1999-08-01  Jim Blandy  <jimb@savonarola.red-bean.com>

	* tests/r4rs.test (SECTION 3 4): Each element of type-matrix
	corresponds to an example object, not a predicate.  Aubrey
	probably never noticed this because SCM doesn't check the lengths
	of the arguments to for-each and map...

	* tests/ports.test: Add some regression tests for char-ready?.

1999-07-19  Jim Blandy  <jimb@savonarola.red-bean.com>

	get EOF on the port --- don't just read forever.

	result, not the cdr.  I'm not macho enough to handle run-time
	typechecking.

	* lib.scm (print-counts): XFAILS are "expected failures", not
	"unexpected failures."

	* lib.scm, guile-test, paths.scm: Log begins.
