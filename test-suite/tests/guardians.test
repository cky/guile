;;; These tests make some questionable assumptions.
;;; - They assume that a GC will find all dead objects, so they
;;;   will become flaky if we have a generational GC.
;;; - They assume that objects won't be saved by the guardian until
;;;   they explicitly invoke GC --- in other words, they assume that GC
;;;   won't happen too often.
