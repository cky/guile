;;; Tests of Emacs 20.4 character encoding.

;;; Check that characters are being encoded correctly.

;;; These tests are specific to the Emacs 20.4 encoding; they'll need
;;; to be replaced when Guile switches to UTF-8.  See mb.c for a
;;; description of this encoding.

;;; the last value which actually corresponds to something in a real
;;; character set.
