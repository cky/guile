2008-04-17  Ludovic Courtès  <ludo@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.am (SCM_BENCHMARKS): Add `benchmarks/read.bm'.
	* benchmarks/read.bm: New file.

2008-01-22  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	* COPYING: Removed.

2006-11-17  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	* README: Note need for subscription to bug-guile@gnu.org.

2006-05-02  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	* Makefile.am (SCM_BENCHMARKS_DIRS, dist-hook): Removed, they are
	no longer needed and lead to unclean tarballs.

2004-01-23  Dirk Herrmann  <dirk@dirk-herrmanns-seiten.de>

	* lib.scm: Extracted '/i' to toplevel.  Print the guile version
	number before the benchmarks are run.  Print the framework-time
	per iteration as an inexact number.

2004-01-06  Marius Vollmer  <marius.vollmer@uni-dortmund.de>

	* lib.scm (print-result, print-user-result): Handle exact
	fractions.

2003-05-27  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* lib.scm: Fix some typos in the documentation.

2002-09-14  Rob Browning  <rlb@defaultvalue.org>

	* .cvsignore: new file.

2002-07-26  Marius Vollmer  <marius.vollmer@uni-dortmund.de>

	* Makefile.am (SCM_BENCHMARKS): List the real benchmarks, not foo
	and bar.
	(SCM_BENCHMARKS_DIRS): Uncommented, with an empty value.
	(dist-hook): Use quotes so that an empty SCM_BENCHMARKS_DIRS works.
	
2002-07-21  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* lib.scm (print-result, print-user-result): Changed the
	reporter's outputs to use symbols rather than strings to document
	the individual values.  Thanks to Neil Jerram for the suggestion.

2002-07-21  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* benchmarks/0-reference.bm:  Added as a reference benchmark to be
	used to calibrate iteration counts.

	* lib.scm: Added documentation.  Added some initialization
	messages.

	(benchmark-time-base, benchmark-total-time, benchmark-user-time,
	benchmark-system-time, benchmark-frame-time, benchmark-core-time,
	benchmark-user-time\interpreter, benchmark-core-time\interpreter):
	Exported.

	(benchmark-time-base, time-base): Renamed time-base to
	benchmark-time-base and introduced new time-base as a short-cut.

	(total-time, benchmark-total-time, user-time, benchmark-user-time,
	system-time, benchmark-system-time, frame-time,
	benchmark-frame-time, benchmark-time, benchmark-core-time,
	user-time\interpreter, benchmark-user-time\interpreter,
	benchmark-time\interpreter, benchmark-core-time\interpreter,
	print-result, print-user-result):  Renamed <foo>-time to
	benchmark-<foo>-time.  Exceptions: benchmark-time and
	benchmark-time\interpreter were renamed to benchmark-core-time and
	benchmark-core-time\interpreter, respectively.

2002-07-20  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* COPYING, README, Makefile.am, lib.scm, guile-benchmark:  Copied
	from the test-suite directory, renamed and adapted for use with
	benchmarks.

	* benchmarks/logand.bm, benchmarks/continuations.bm,
	benchmarks/if.bm:  Added as initial fairly stupid examples for
	benchmarks.

2002-07-20  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* Log begins.
