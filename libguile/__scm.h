/**********************************************************************
 This file is Guile's central public header.

 When included by other files, this file should preceed any include
 other than __scm.h.

 Under *NO* circumstances should new items be added to the global
 namespace (via adding #define, typedef, or similar to this file) with
 generic names.  This usually means that any new names should be
 prefixed by either SCM_ or GUILE_.  i.e. do *not* #define HAVE_FOO or
 SIZEOF_BAR.  See configure.in, gen-scmconfig.h.in, and
 gen-scmconfig.c for examples of how to properly handle this issue.
 The main documentation is in gen-scmconfig.c.

 "What's the difference between _scm.h and __scm.h?"

   _scm.h is not installed; it's only visible to the libguile sources
   themselves, and it includes config.h, the private config header.

   __scm.h is installed, and is #included by <libguile.h>.  If both
   the client and libguile need some piece of information, and it
   doesn't fit well into the header file for any particular module, it
   should go in __scm.h.  __scm.h includes scmconfig.h, the public
   config header.

/* {Architecture and compiler properties}
 *
 * Guile as of today can only work on systems which fulfill at least the
 * following requirements:
 *
 * - scm_t_bits and SCM variables have at least 32 bits.
 *   Guile's type system is based on this assumption.
 *
 * - sizeof (scm_t_bits) >= sizeof (void*) and sizeof (SCM) >= sizeof (void*)
 *   Guile's type system is based on this assumption, since it must be
 *   possible to store pointers to cells on the heap in scm_t_bits and SCM
 *   variables.
 *
 * - sizeof (scm_t_bits) >= 4 and sizeof (scm_t_bits) is a power of 2.
 *   Guile's type system is based on this assumption.  In particular, it is
 *   assumed that cells, i. e. pairs of scm_t_bits variables, are eight
 *   character aligned.  This is because three bits of a scm_t_bits variable
 *   that is holding a pointer to a cell on the heap must be available for
 *   storing type data.
 *
 * - sizeof (scm_t_bits) <= sizeof (void*) and sizeof (SCM) <= sizeof (void*)
 *   In some parts of guile, scm_t_bits and SCM variables are passed to
 *   functions as void* arguments.  Together with the requirement above, this
 *   requires a one-to-one correspondence between the size of a void* and the
 *   sizes of scm_t_bits and SCM variables.
 *
 * - numbers are encoded using two's complement.
 *   The implementation of the bitwise scheme level operations is based on
 *   this assumption.
