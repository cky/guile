/* In the beginning was the Word:
 *
 * For the representation of scheme objects and their handling, Guile provides
 * two types:  scm_t_bits and SCM.
 *
 * - scm_t_bits values can hold bit patterns of non-objects and objects:
 *
 *   Non-objects -- in this case the value may not be changed into a SCM value
 *   in any way.
 *
 *   Objects -- in this case the value may be changed into a SCM value using
 *   the SCM_PACK macro.
 *
 * - SCM values can hold proper scheme objects only.  They can be changed into
 *   a scm_t_bits value using the SCM_UNPACK macro.
 *
 * When working in the domain of scm_t_bits values, programmers must keep
 * track of any scm_t_bits value they create that is not a proper scheme
 * object.  This makes sure that in the domain of SCM values developers can
 * rely on the fact that they are dealing with proper scheme objects only.
 * Thus, the distinction between scm_t_bits and SCM values helps to identify
 * those parts of the code where special care has to be taken not to create
 * bad SCM values.
 */

/* Representation of scheme objects:
 *
 * Guile's type system is designed to work on systems where scm_t_bits and SCM
 * variables consist of at least 32 bits.  The objects that a SCM variable can
 * represent belong to one of the following two major categories:
 *
 * - Immediates -- meaning that the SCM variable contains an entire Scheme
 *   object.  That means, all the object's data (including the type tagging
 *   information that is required to identify the object's type) must fit into
 *   32 bits.
 *
 * - Non-immediates -- meaning that the SCM variable holds a pointer into the
 *   heap of cells (see below).  On systems where a pointer needs more than 32
 *   bits this means that scm_t_bits and SCM variables need to be large enough
 *   to hold such pointers.  In contrast to immediates, the object's data of
 *   a non-immediate can consume arbitrary amounts of memory: The heap cell
 *   being pointed to consists of at least two scm_t_bits variables and thus
 *   can be used to hold pointers to malloc'ed memory of any size.
 *
 * The 'heap' is the memory area that is under control of Guile's garbage
 * collector.  It holds 'single-cells' or 'double-cells', which consist of
 * either two or four scm_t_bits variables, respectively.  It is guaranteed
 * that the address of a cell on the heap is 8-byte aligned.  That is, since
 * non-immediates hold a cell address, the three least significant bits of a
 * non-immediate can be used to store additional information.  The bits are
 * used to store information about the object's type and thus are called
 * tc3-bits, where tc stands for type-code.  
 *
 * For a given SCM value, the distinction whether it holds an immediate or
 * non-immediate object is based on the tc3-bits (see above) of its scm_t_bits
 * equivalent: If the tc3-bits equal #b000, then the SCM value holds a
 * non-immediate, and the scm_t_bits variable's value is just the pointer to
 * the heap cell.
 *
 * Summarized, the data of a scheme object that is represented by a SCM
 * variable consists of a) the SCM variable itself, b) in case of
 * non-immediates the data of the single-cell or double-cell the SCM object
 * points to, c) in case of non-immediates potentially additional data outside
 * of the heap (like for example malloc'ed data), and d) in case of
 * non-immediates potentially additional data inside of the heap, since data
 * stored in b) and c) may hold references to other cells.
 *
 *
 * Immediates
 *
 * Operations on immediate objects can typically be processed faster than on
 * non-immediates.  The reason is that the object's data can be extracted
 * directly from the SCM variable (or rather a corresponding scm_t_bits
 * variable), instead of having to perform additional memory accesses to
 * obtain the object's data from the heap.  In order to get the best possible
 * performance frequently used data types should be realized as immediates.
 * This is, as has been mentioned above, only possible if the objects can be
 * represented with 32 bits (including type tagging).
 *
 * In Guile, the following data types and special objects are realized as
 * immediates: booleans, characters, small integers (see below), the empty
 * list, the end of file object, the 'unspecified' object (which is delivered
 * as a return value by functions for which the return value is unspecified),
 * a 'nil' object used in the elisp-compatibility mode and certain other
 * 'special' objects which are only used internally in Guile.
 *
 * Integers in Guile can be arbitrarily large.  On the other hand, integers
 * are one of the most frequently used data types.  Especially integers with
 * less than 32 bits are commonly used.  Thus, internally and transparently
 * for application code guile distinguishes between small and large integers.
 * Whether an integer is a large or a small integer depends on the number of
 * bits needed to represent its value.  Small integers are those which can be
 * represented as immediates.  Since they don't require more than a fixed
 * number of bits for their representation, they are also known as 'fixnums'.
 *
 * The tc3-combinations #b010 and #b110 are used to represent small integers,
 * which allows to use the most significant bit of the tc3-bits to be part of
 * the integer value being represented.  This means that all integers with up
 * to 30 bits (including one bit for the sign) can be represented as
 * immediates.  On systems where SCM and scm_t_bits variables hold more than
 * 32 bits, the amount of bits usable for small integers will even be larger.
 * The tc3-code #b100 is shared among booleans, characters and the other
 * special objects listed above.
 *
 *
 * Non-Immediates
 *
 * All object types not mentioned above in the list of immedate objects are
 * represented as non-immediates.  Whether a non-immediate scheme object is
 * represented by a single-cell or a double-cell depends on the object's type,
 * namely on the set of attributes that have to be stored with objects of that
 * type.  Every non-immediate type is allowed to define its own layout and
 * interpretation of the data stored in its cell (with some restrictions, see
 * below).
 *
 * One of the design goals of guile's type system is to make it possible to
 * store a scheme pair with as little memory usage as possible.  The minimum
 * amount of memory that is required to store two scheme objects (car and cdr
 * of a pair) is the amount of memory required by two scm_t_bits or SCM
 * variables.  Therefore pairs in guile are stored in single-cells.
 *
 * Another design goal for the type system is to store procedure objects
 * created by lambda expresssions (closures) and class instances (goops
 * objects) with as little memory usage as possible.  Closures are represented
 * by a reference to the function code and a reference to the closure's
 * environment.  Class instances are represented by a reference to the
 * instance's class definition and a reference to the instance's data.  Thus,
 * closures as well as class instances also can be stored in single-cells.
 *
 * Certain other non-immediate types also store their data in single-cells.
 * By design decision, the heap is split into areas for single-cells and
 * double-cells, but not into areas for single-cells-holding-pairs and areas
 * for single-cells-holding-non-pairs.  Any single-cell on the heap therefore
 * can hold pairs (consisting of two scm_t_bits variables representing two
 * scheme objects - the car and cdr of the pair) and non-pairs (consisting of
 * two scm_t_bits variables that hold bit patterns as defined by the layout of
 * the corresponding object's type).
 *
 *
 * Garbage collection
 *
 * During garbage collection, unreachable cells on the heap will be freed.
 * That is, the garbage collector will detect cells which have no SCM variable
 * pointing towards them.  In order to properly release all memory belonging
 * to the object to which a cell belongs, the gc needs to be able to interpret
 * the cell contents in the correct way.  That means that the gc needs to be
 * able to determine the object type associated with a cell only from the cell
 * itself.
 *
 * Consequently, if the gc detects an unreachable single-cell, those two
 * scm_t_bits variables must provide enough information to determine whether
 * they belong to a pair (i. e. both scm_t_bits variables represent valid
 * scheme objects), to a closure, a class instance or if they belong to any
 * other non-immediate.  Guile's type system is designed to make it possible
 * to determine a the type to which a cell belongs in the majority of cases
 * from the cell's first scm_t_bits variable.  (Given a SCM variable X holding
 * a non-immediate object, the macro SCM_CELL_TYPE(X) will deliver the
 * corresponding cell's first scm_t_bits variable.)
 *
 * If the cell holds a scheme pair, then we already know that the first
 * scm_t_bits variable of the cell will hold a scheme object with one of the
 * following tc3-codes: #b000 (non-immediate), #b010 (small integer), #b110
 * (small integer), #b100 (non-integer immediate).  All these tc3-codes have
 * in common, that their least significant bit is #b0.  This fact is used by
 * the garbage collector to identify cells that hold pairs.  The remaining
 * tc3-codes are assigned as follows: #b001 (class instance or, more
 * precisely, a struct, of which a class instance is a special case), #b011
 * (closure), #b101/#b111 (all remaining non-immediate types).
 *
 *
 * Summary of type codes of scheme objects (SCM variables)
 *
 * Here is a summary of tagging bits as they might occur in a scheme object.
 * The notation is as follows: tc stands for type code as before, tc<n> with n
 * being a number indicates a type code formed by the n least significant bits
 * of the SCM variables corresponding scm_t_bits value.
 *
 * Note that (as has been explained above) tc1==1 can only occur in the first
 * scm_t_bits variable of a cell belonging to a non-immediate object that is
 * not a pair.  For an explanation of the tc tags with tc1==1, see the next
 * section with the summary of the type codes on the heap.
 *
 * tc1:
 *   0:  For scheme objects, tc1==0 must be fulfilled.
 *  (1:  This can never be the case for a scheme object.)
 *
 * tc2:
 *   00:  Either a non-immediate or some non-integer immediate
 *  (01:  This can never be the case for a scheme object.)
 *   10:  Small integer
 *  (11:  This can never be the case for a scheme object.)
 *
 * tc3:
 *   000:  a non-immediate object (pair, closure, class instance etc.)
 *  (001:  This can never be the case for a scheme object.)
 *   010:  an even small integer (least significant bit is 0).
 *  (011:  This can never be the case for a scheme object.)
 *   100:  Non-integer immediate
 *  (101:  This can never be the case for a scheme object.)
 *   110:  an odd small integer (least significant bit is 1).
 *  (111:  This can never be the case for a scheme object.)
 *
 * The remaining bits of the non-immediate objects form the pointer to the
 * heap cell.  The remaining bits of the small integers form the integer's
 * value and sign.  Thus, the only scheme objects for which a further
 * subdivision is of interest are the ones with tc3==100.
 *
 * tc8 (for objects with tc3==100):
 *   00000-100:  special objects ('flags')
 *   00001-100:  characters
 *   00010-100:  unused
 *   00011-100:  unused
 *
 *
 * Summary of type codes on the heap
 *
 * Here is a summary of tagging in scm_t_bits values as they might occur in
 * the first scm_t_bits variable of a heap cell.
 *
 * tc1:
 *   0:  the cell belongs to a pair.
 *   1:  the cell belongs to a non-pair.
 *
 * tc2:
 *   00:  the cell belongs to a pair with no short integer in its car.
 *   01:  the cell belongs to a non-pair (struct or some other non-immediate).
 *   10:  the cell belongs to a pair with a short integer in its car.
 *   11:  the cell belongs to a non-pair (closure or some other non-immediate).
 *
 * tc3:
 *   000:  the cell belongs to a pair with a non-immediate in its car.
 *   001:  the cell belongs to a struct
 *   010:  the cell belongs to a pair with an even short integer in its car.
 *   011:  the cell belongs to a closure
 *   100:  the cell belongs to a pair with a non-integer immediate in its car.
 *   101:  the cell belongs to some other non-immediate.
 *   110:  the cell belongs to a pair with an odd short integer in its car.
 *   111:  the cell belongs to some other non-immediate.
 *
 * tc7 (for tc3==1x1):
 *   See below for the list of types.  Note the special case of scm_tc7_vector
 *   and scm_tc7_wvect:  vectors and weak vectors are treated the same in many
 *   cases.  Thus, their tc7-codes are chosen to only differ in one bit.  This
 *   makes it possible to check an object at the same time for being a vector
 *   or a weak vector by comparing its tc7 code with that bit masked (using
 *   the TYP7S macro).  Three more special tc7-codes are of interest:
 *   numbers, ports and smobs in fact each represent collections of types,
 *   which are subdivided using tc16-codes.
 *
 * tc16 (for tc7==scm_tc7_smob):
 *   The largest part of the space of smob types is not subdivided in a
 *   predefined way, since smobs can be added arbitrarily by user C code.
