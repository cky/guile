  Description of Guile's public config header mechanics:
  ----------------------------------------------------- 

  Guile has four core headers:

    config.h: Guile's private automatically generated configuration
      header -- generated by configure.in and autoheader.  *NOT*
      installed during "make install" and so may not be referred to by
      any public headers.

    libguile/_scm.h: Guile's private core header.  _scm.h is not
      installed.  It's only visible to the libguile sources
      themselves, and it includes config.h, the private config header.
      Among other things this file provides a place to make decisions
      based on the information gathered in config.h.

    libguile/scmconfig.h: Guile's public automatically generated
      configuration header -- generated at build time by concatenating
      the contents of libguile/scmconfig.h.top with the output from
      libguile/gen-scmconfig.  gen-scmconfig bases its output on the
      information in the private config.h header, the contents of
      gen-scmconfig.h (which is created by configure.in from
      gen-scmconfig.h.in), and the information provided in this file,
      gen-scmconfig.c.

    libguile/__scm.h: Guile's public core header.  This file is
      installed and publically visible.  It includes
      libguile/scmconfig.h, the public config header and provides a
      place to make decisions based on the information gathered in
      scmconfig.h to define things that other headers can depend on.

   Notes and guidelines:

   - in the code below, be *VERY* careful not to use or rely on any
     runtime-dynamic information below.  For example, you cannot use
     sizeof (FOO), but must use static information like SIZEOF_BAR
     (from config.h) or SCM_SIZEOF_BAZ (from scmconfig.h).  This is
     because the gcc that is compiling gen-scmconfig.c and/or the
     machine that is running gen-scmconfig may not be the same
     compiler and/or hardware that will eventually be running Guile.
     (i.e. keep the cross-compilation case in mind).

   - try to avoid adding names to the public namespace when possible.
     Note in the code below, that in a number of cases, we detect a
     feature and based on that, we decide whether or not to print
     anything at all.  This decreases the extraneous #defines and
     #ifdefery that we require in scmconfig.h

   - try to avoid adding any duplicate definitions to config.h and
     scmconfig.h.  i.e. have just SCM_ENABLE_ELISP in scmconfig.h
     rather than ENABLE_ELISP in config.h and SCM_ENABLE_ELISP in
     scmconfig.h.

   - in cases where you need to communicate information from
     configure.in to gen-scmconfig.c, don't add an AC_DEFINE unless
     you need it for other purposes.  Just add a suitable SCM_I_GSC_*
     variable to configure.in, set the value, AC_SUBST the value, and
     add an appropriate line to gen-scmconfig.h.in.  All gen-scmconfig
     related AC_SUBST vars should be prefixed with SCM_I_GSC_.

   - make sure that anything that we explicitly typedef publically is
     prefixed with scm_t_.  i.e. we used to typedef long to ptrdiff_t
     if we didn't detect ptrdiff_t, but this has been changed so that
     we typedef scm_t_ptrdiff instead so that we won't conflict with
     any non-guile header definitions of the same type.  For types
     like intptr_t and uintptr_t which we just try to detect and don't
     actually define, it's fine not to have a corresponding scm_t_
     type.

   - we now use SCM_SIZEOF_FOO != 0 rather than SCM_HAVE_FOO for any
     cases where the size might actually vary.  For types where the
     size is fixed, we use SCM_HAVE_FOO, i.e. you can see us define or
     not define SCM_HAVE_T_INT64 below when appropriate.

   Rationales (not finished):

     Why do we use a C program here rather than AC_OUTPUT_COMMANDS?
     --------------------------------------------------------------

     The main reason is that there are some values we would need
     access to at AC_OUTPUT_COMMANDs that are determined by configure
     but are not available at AC_OUTPUT time.  The values are *only*
     available via config.h.  We use gen-scmconfig so we can see those
     values and make decisions based on their settings.

     Why have gen-scmconfig.h.in?
     ----------------------------

     Without that header, we could end up needing multiple aliases for
     public settings like SCM_ENABLE_ELISP.  We can't define
     SCM_ENABLE_ELISP in config.h since that header is private and any
     definition in scmconfig.h would conflict (#ifndef might be
     possible but runs the risk of conflicting directives), so a
     likely solution would be to AC_DEFINE([SCM_I_ENABLE_ELISP]), and
     then use SCM_I_ENABLE_ELISP in gen-scmconfig via config.h to
     determine whether or not to #define SCM_ENABLE_ELISP, but this
     leaves us with two #defined symbols for each public setting --
     better to just have one value (public or private) that all code
     uses.

     Having this header means we can AC_SUBST a value like
     SCM_I_GSC_ENABLE_ELISP and then set it in here via AC_OUTPUT
     substitutions, and gen-scmconfig can use that definition to
     determine whether or not to #define SCM_ENABLE_ELISP when
     generating scmconfig.h, and we end up with nothing extraneous
     added to config.h.
