	Fix builds `--without-threads'.  Reported by Han-Wen Nienhuys
	<hanwen@xs4all.nl>.

	* scmsigs.c (scm_i_close_signal_pipe): Don't refer to
	`signal_pipe' unless `SCM_USE_PTHREAD_THREADS' is true.

	    Ludovic Courtès  <ludo@gnu.org>

	* goops.c (scm_init_goops_builtins, go_to_hell): Fix allocation
	of `hell' by passing "hell_size * sizeof (*hell)" instead of
	"hell_size" to `scm_malloc ()' and `scm_realloc ()'.

2008-08-02  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	* numbers.c (scm_rationalize): Update docstring to match the
	manual (which is more correct).  Change argument "err" to "eps",
	also to match the manual.

2008-07-17  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	From Thiemo Seufer <ths@networkno.de>:
	
	* gc_os_dep.c (CPP_WORDSZ, ALIGN_DOUBLE, DATAEND,

	(readdir_r_or_readdir64_r): Depend on `SCM_HAVE_READDIR64_R',
	for HP-UX 11.11.

2008-07-05  Ludovic Courtès  <ludo@gnu.org>

	since it's needed by `libguile-i18n'.  Reported by Patrick
	Horgan <phorgan1@gmail.com>.

	* __scm.h (SCM_INTERNAL): Add `extern' so that these symbols are
	not considered as "common" by GCC 4.3.  Reported by Patrick
	Horgan <phorgan1@gmail.com>.

2008-06-28  Ludovic Courtès  <ludo@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Renamed to...
	(AM_CPPFLAGS): this, to match current Automake conventions.
	Users updated.

	* tags.h (SCM_UNPACK): Disable type-checking for `__DECC' and
	`__HP_cc'.  Reported by Peter O'Gorman <pogma@thewrittenword.com>.

2008-06-02  Ludovic Courtès  <ludo@gnu.org>

	* deprecated.c (maybe_close_port): Rename EXCEPT to EXCEPT_SET
	to workaround `#define except' on Tru64.  Reported by Peter
	O'Gorman <pogma@thewrittenword.com>.

2008-05-31  Ludovic Courtès  <ludo@gnu.org>

	* __scm.h (SCM_INTERNAL): New macro.
	* *.h: Use it to mark as internal `scm_i_' and `scm_init_'
	functions that are not used by public macros or inline
	functions.

2008-05-14  Julian Graham  <joolean@gmail.com>

	* threads.c (fat_mutex)[recursive]: New field.
	(make_fat_mutex): Adjust initialization to reflect changes to
	mutex lock level semantics.

2008-05-12  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	* discouraged.c: Expand DEFFROM and DEFTO macros, to avoid
	compiler warnings about excess semicolons.  (Reported by Didier
	Godefroy.)

2008-05-08  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	* throw.c (scm_ithrow): For IA64 add a return statement, to
	appease GCC.

	* threads.h (scm_i_thread): New IA64 fields:
	register_backing_store_base and pending_rbs_continuation.

	* threads.c (guilify_self_1): For IA64: cap RBS base address at
	the current value of scm_ia64_ar_bsp, and store the capped value
	in thread state.
	(SCM_MARK_BACKING_STORE): Use thread->register_backing_store_base
	instead of scm_ia64_register_backing_store_base().
	(scm_threads_mark_stacks): Add "&" in "&t->regs", so that the code
	works both for jmp_buf defined as an array, and jmp_buf defined as
	a struct.

	* continuations.h (scm_t_contregs): Remove `fresh' and `ctx'
	fields; these are now inside the IA64 definition of `jmp_buf'.

	* continuations.c (scm_make_continuation): Simplify, by moving
	some of the IA64 code inside the definition of "setjmp", and by
	some obvious commonizations.  For IA64 register backing store
	(RBS) stack base, use thread->register_backing_store_base instead
	of scm_ia64_register_backing_store_base().
	(copy_stack): For IA64, store pointer to continuation being
	invoked in thread state, so we can restore the continuation's RBS
	stack just before the next setcontext call.
	(copy_stack_and_call): Don't restore RBS stack explicitly here.
	It will be restored, if appropriate, inside the longjmp call.
	(scm_ia64_longjmp): New function.

	* __scm.h (setjmp, longjmp, jmp_buf): For IA64, implement using
	getcontext and setcontext.

2008-05-07  Ludovic Courtès  <ludo@gnu.org>

	* numbers.c (scm_from_complex_double): Mark as `SCM_UNUSED'.
	This fixes compilation with `-Werror' on FreeBSD 6.2 (i386).

2008-05-05  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	* c-tokenize.lex: #define YY_NO_INPUT.

2008-04-26  Ludovic Courtès  <ludo@gnu.org>

	* read.c (scm_read_sexp): Remove extraneous semi-colon at
	end-of-line, which broke compilation with GCC 2.7.  Reported by
	Alain Guibert <alguibert+bts@free.fr>.

2008-04-24  Ludovic Courtès  <ludo@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.am (DEFAULT_INCLUDES): New.  Fixes compilation on
	Tru64 where our "random.h" would shadown libc's one.
	(INCLUDES): Add "-I$(top_buildir)", which is normally in
	`DEFAULT_INCLUDES'.
	* gen-scmconfig.c: Include <libguile/gen-scmconfig.h>, not
	"gen-scmconfig.h" since that file is under `$(builddir)'.

2008-04-16  Ludovic Courtès  <ludo@gnu.org>

	* ports.c (scm_getc, scm_putc, scm_puts): Moved...
	* inline.h: ... here.  Noticeably improves `read' performance.

2008-04-15  Ludovic Courtès  <ludo@gnu.org>
	    Julian Graham  <joolean@gmail.com>

	* read.c (scm_keyword_postfix): New.

	(scm_read_mixed_case_symbol): Add support for postfix keywords.

2008-04-13  Ludovic Courtès  <ludo@gnu.org>

	* inline.h (SCM_C_USE_EXTERN_INLINE): New macro.  Use it to make
	sure "extern" declarations are produced when "extern inline" is
	used.  Simplify macrology around inline definitions.

2008-04-10  Ludovic Courtès  <ludo@gnu.org>

	* inline.h (SCM_C_EXTERN_INLINE): Special-case Apple's GCC
	4.0-based compiler, which doesn't support GNU inline semantics
	at all in C99 mode but doesn't define `__GNUC_STDC_INLINE__'.
	See http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.network.gnutls.general/1135 .

2008-04-10  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* struct.c (scm_struct_ref, scm_struct_set_x): "Light" structs
	have no hidden words (members of the SCM_STRUCT_DATA(x) array
	accessed with negative indices). In that case, determine the
	number of fields from the length of the struct layout
	descriptor. (Most GOOPS instances are light structs.)

	* goops.c (wrap_init): Initialize 'u' slots to 0, not some random
	SCM value.

	* goops.c (get_slot_value, set_slot_value): In the struct
	allocation case, don't poke the slots array directly -- we should
	go through struct-ref/struct-set! code so that we get the
	permissions and allocation ('u' versus 'p') correct.

2008-04-03  Ludovic Courtès  <ludo@gnu.org>

	* inline.h (SCM_C_EXTERN_INLINE): New macro, addresses the
	"extern inline" semantic change in C99 mode with GCC 4.3 and
	later and the warning in C99 mode with GCC 4.2.  Use it in the
	inline function definitions.

2008-03-24  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	Applying patch from Julian Graham, containing minor fixes to his
	thread enhancements:

	* threads.c (to_timespec): Change 1000000 multiplier to
	1000000000.
	(unchecked_unlock_sym, allow_external_unlock_sym,
	recursive_sym): Use SCM_SYMBOL.
	(scm_make_mutex_with_flags): When raising unsupported option
	error, report what the unsupported option was.
	(fat_mutex_unlock): When raising errors, unlock m->lock first.
	(fat_cond_timedwait): Removed.
	(scm_timed_wait_condition_variable): Call fat_mutex_unlock
	directly instead of via fat_cond_timedwait.

2008-03-10  Ludovic Courtès  <ludo@gnu.org>

	* eval.c, filesys.c: Enclose `alloca' blob in `#ifndef alloca',
	as per Gnulib's `alloca'.  This should fix compilation on
	FreeBSD 6.

2008-03-09  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	* numbers.c: Only define scm_from_complex_double if it will
	actually be used.

2008-03-08  Julian Graham  <joolean@gmail.com>

	* threads.c (scm_join_thread_timed, scm_thread_p,

	(scm_abandoned_mutex_error_key): New symbol.
	(fat_mutex)[unchecked_unlock, allow_external_unlock]: New fields.
	(fat_mutex_lock): Reimplement to support timeouts and abandonment.
	(fat_mutex_trylock, scm_try_mutex): Remove fat_mutex_trylock and
	reimplement scm_try_mutex as a lock attempt with a timeout of zero.
	(fat_mutex_unlock): Allow unlocking from other threads and unchecked
	unlocking; implement in terms of condition variable wait.
	(scm_timed_wait_condition_variable): Reimplement in terms of
	fat_mutex_unlock.
	* threads.h (scm_i_thread)[mutexes]: New field.
	(scm_join_thread_timed, scm_thread_p, scm_lock_mutex_timed,
	scm_unlock_mutex_timed, scm_mutex_p, scm_condition_variable_p):
	Prototypes for new functions.

2008-03-06  Ludovic Courtès  <ludo@gnu.org>

	* eval.c (scm_eval): If MODULE_OR_STATE is not a dynamic state,

2008-03-02  Ludovic Courtès  <ludo@gnu.org>

	* pairs.h (scm_is_pair): Moved declaration to `inline.h'.
	* inline.h: Make sure `extern' declarations are not produced
	when `inline' is supported but GCC is not used.  This
	fixes "mixed linkage" errors with compilers such as
	DEC/Compaq/HP CC.

2008-02-27  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	* _scm.h (errno): Remove declarations that have been there
	forever, and are known to conflict on some platforms with that
	provided by <errno.h>, which we include unconditionally.  If
	<errno.h> doesn't provide a errno declaration, what is the point
	of it?

2008-02-23  Ludovic Courtès  <ludo@gnu.org>

	* numbers.c (scm_make_rectangular): Rename argument to
	`real_part' and `imaginary_part' to work around Solaris 2.10
	headers which define `imaginary' as a macro.  Patch by Tim
	Mooney <mooney@dogbert.cc.ndsu.NoDak.edu>.

2008-02-22  Ludovic Courtès  <ludo@gnu.org>

	* read.c (strncasecmp): Add declaration when

2008-02-12  Ludovic Courtès  <ludo@gnu.org>

	* guile-snarf.in (tempdir): Honor `$TMPDIR'.

2008-02-11  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	* numbers.c (SCM_COMPLEX_VALUE): Use GUILE_I instead of _Complex_I
	directly, and only if GUILE_I was defined by the configure step.
	(scm_log, scm_log10, scm_exp, scm_sqrt): Use SCM_COMPLEX_VALUE
	code only if SCM_COMPLEX_VALUE is defined.

2008-02-07  Ludovic Courtès  <ludo@gnu.org>

	Fix bug #21378.
	Thanks to David Diffenbaugh <davediff@nbcs.rutgers.edu>.

	* read.c (scm_read_quote): Don't use `__FUNCTION__' since it is
	not supported by Sun CC on Solaris 9.
	(scm_read_keyword): Likewise.
	* strings.c (scm_take_locale_stringn): Remove
	`SCM_C_INLINE_KEYWORD' to allow compilation with Sun CC.

2008-02-07  Julian Graham  <joolean@gmail.com>

	* threads.c (do_thread_exit, scm_cancel_thread,
	scm_set_thread_cleanup_x, scm_thread_cleanup): Lock on thread-specific
	admin mutex instead of `thread_admin_mutex'.
	* threads.h (scm_i_thread)[admin_mutex]: New field.
	* throw.c (make_jmpbuf): Don't enter critical section during thread
	spawn -- there is a possibility of deadlock if other threads are
	exiting.

2008-02-06  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	* gc-malloc.c (scm_gc_malloc): Return NULL if requested size is 0.

	scm_i_clonebig, scm_i_bigcmp, scm_i_dbl2big, scm_i_dbl2num,
	scm_i_normbig): Remove `SCM_C_INLINE_KEYWORD' since these are
	declared as `extern' in `numbers.h'.  This precluded compilation
	on Solaris 9 with Sun CC (reported by David Halik
	<dhalik@nbcs.rutgers.edu>).

2008-02-05  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	* fports.c (fport_seek): Make dependent on GUILE_USE_64_CALLS.

	* _scm.h: Make definition of CHOOSE_LARGEFILE depend on

	(_scm_from_sockaddr): Change ADDRESS to `scm_t_max_sockaddr *'.
	(scm_from_sockaddr): Cast ADDRESS to `scm_t_max_sockaddr *'.
	(MAX_SIZE_UN, MAX_SIZE_IN6): Removed.
	(scm_accept, scm_getsockname, scm_getpeername, scm_recvfrom):
	Use `scm_t_max_sockaddr' instead of "char max_addr[MAX_ADDR_SIZE]".

2007-09-03  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* numbers.c (scm_log): Test HAVE_CLOG as well as HAVE_COMPLEX_DOUBLE
	before using clog().  It's possible for gcc to provide the "complex
	double" type, but for the system not to have the complex funcs.
	(scm_exp): Ditto HAVE_CEXP for cexp().
	(clog, cexp, carg): Remove fallback definitions.  These only
	duplicated the code within scm_log and scm_exp, and the latter have to
	exist for the case when there's no "complex double".  So better just
	fix up the conditionals selecting between the complex funcs and plain
	doubles than worry about fallbacks.

2007-09-02  Ludovic Courtès  <ludo@gnu.org>

	* socket.c (scm_make_socket_address): Free C_ADDRESS after use.
	This fixes a memory leak.

2007-08-26  Han-Wen Nienhuys  <hanwen@lilypond.org>

	* fports.c gc-card.c gc.c gc.h ioext.c ports.c ports.h weaks.h
	gc.c: replace port table with weak hash table. This simplifies
	memory management, and fixes freed cells appearing in
	port-for-each output.

	* init.c (cleanup_for_exit): abort cleanup if init_mutex is still
	held.

2007-08-23  Ludovic Courtès  <ludo@gnu.org>

	* read.c (scm_read_quote): Record position and copy source
	expression when asked to.  Reported by Kevin.

	* stime.c: Define `_REENTRANT' only if not already defined.

2007-08-21  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* gc-card.c (scm_i_card_statistics): Record scm_tc7_number types as
	tc16 values so big, real, complex and fraction can be distinguished.

	(scm_i_tag_name): Return "number" for scm_tc7_number, not NULL.  NULL
	was making numbers come out as "type 23" in gc-live-object-stats.
	Fix tests of the tc16 number types, they were checked under
	scm_tc7_number, but the values went down the tag>=255 smob case.
	Put smob case under scm_tc7_smob instead of using tag>=255, per
	recommendation in comments with scm_tc7_smob to use symbolic values.
	Use SCM_TC2SMOBNUM to extract scm_smobs index, instead of explicit
	code.  Lose some unnecessary "break" statements.

	(scm_i_card_statistics): Use scm_hashq_create_handle_x and modify the
	element returned, rather than two lookups scm_hashq_ref and
	scm_hashq_set_x.

2007-08-17  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* stime.c: Add #define _REENTRANT, to get gmtime_r() prototype on
	solaris 2.6.  Reported by anirkko.

2007-07-29  Ludovic Courtès  <ludo@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Added Gnulib includes.
	(gnulib_library): New.
	(libguile_i18n_v_@LIBGUILE_I18N_MAJOR@_la_LIBADD): Added
	`$(gnulib_library)'.
	(libguile_la_LIBADD): Likewise.

	* posix.c: Don't define `_GNU_SOURCE' since `gl_EARLY' arranges
	to define it when available.
	* srfi-14.c: Likewise.
	* i18n.c: Likewise.  Include Gnulib's <alloca.h>
	* eval.c: Include Gnulib's <alloca.h>.
	* filesys.c: Likewise.
	* read.c: Don't include <strings.h> and don't provide an
	`strncasecmp ()' replacement; use Gnulib's <string.h> and
	`strncasecmp ()' instead.

2007-07-25  Ludovic Courtès  <ludo@gnu.org>

	* eval.c (macroexp): When `scm_ilength (res) <= 0', return
	immediately.  This used to produce a circular memoized
	expression, e.g., for `(set (quote x) #t)'.

2007-07-22  Ludovic Courtès  <ludo@gnu.org>

	Overhauled the reader, making it faster.

	* gdbint.c (tok_buf, tok_buf_mark_p): Removed.
	(gdb_read): Don't use a token buffer.  Use `scm_read ()' instead
	of `scm_lreadr ()'.

	* read.c: Overhauled.  No longer use a token buffer.  Use a
	on-stack C buffer in the common case and use Scheme strings when
	larger buffers are needed.
	* read.h (scm_grow_tok_buf, scm_flush_ws, scm_casei_streq,
	scm_lreadr, scm_lreadrecparen): Removed.
	(scm_i_input_error): Marked as `SCM_NORETURN'.

2007-07-15  Ludovic Courtès  <ludo@gnu.org>

	* script.c (scm_compile_shell_switches): Updated copyright year.

2007-07-11  Ludovic Courtès  <ludo@gnu.org>

	* goops.c (scm_sys_method_more_specific_p): Added docstring.
	Make sure LEN is greater than or equal to the minimum length of
	specializers of M1 and M2.  This fixes a segfault later on in
	`more_specificp ()' if TARGS is too small.  Reported by Marco
	Maggi <marco.maggi-ipsu@poste.it>.

2007-06-26  Ludovic Courtès  <ludo@gnu.org>

	* fluids.c (next_fluid_num): When growing ALLOCATED_FLUIDS, make
	sure to free the previous array after the new one has been
	installed.  This leak is made visible by running
	"(define l (map (lambda (i) (make-fluid)) (iota 255)))"
	from the REPL within Valgrind.

2007-06-12  Ludovic Courtès  <ludo@chbouib.org>

	* socket.c (scm_inet_ntop): In the `AF_INET' case, declare `addr4'
	as an `scm_t_uint32' rather than re-using `addr6'.  This fixes a
	bus error on SPARC (and possibly others) due to unaligned access.

2007-06-07  Ludovic Courtès  <ludovic.courtes@laas.fr>

	* posix.c (scm_ttyname): Check whether RESULT is NULL before
	making a string from it (reported by Dan McMahill).  Don't call
	`scm_from_locale_string ()' before the mutex is released.

2007-05-26  Ludovic Courtès  <ludo@chbouib.org>

	* eval.c (scm_m_define): Updated comment.  Changed order for value
	evaluation and `scm_sym2var ()' call, which is perfectly valid per
	R5RS.  This reverts the change dated 2004-04-22 by Dirk Herrmann.

2007-05-05  Ludovic Courtès  <ludo@chbouib.org>

	Implemented lazy duplicate binding handling.

	* modules.c (scm_export): Renamed to...
	(scm_module_export): This.  Now public.
	(module_variable): Removed.
	(default_duplicate_binding_procedures_var): New variable.
	(default_duplicate_binding_handlers, resolve_duplicate_binding,
	module_imported_variable, scm_module_local_variable,
	scm_module_variable): New functions.
	(scm_module_import_interface): Rewritten.
	(scm_module_reverse_lookup): Exported as a Scheme function.
	* modules.h (scm_module_index_duplicate_handlers,
	scm_module_index_import_obarray): New macros.
	(scm_module_variable, scm_module_local_variable,
	scm_module_export): New declarations.

2007-04-17  Ludovic Courtès  <ludovic.courtes@laas.fr>

	* numbers.c: Commented out trailing `HAVE_COMPLEX_DOUBLE' after
	`#endif'.  Use `#ifndef HAVE_XXX' rather than `#if !HAVE_XXX'.

2007-04-09  Han-Wen Nienhuys  <hanwen@lilypond.org>

	* numbers.c (carg): provide carg, cexp, clog in case they are
	missing.

2007-03-12  Ludovic Courtès  <ludovic.courtes@laas.fr>

	* i18n.c (scm_nl_langinfo): `#ifdef'd uses of `GROUPING',
	`FRAC_DIGITS', etc., which are GNU extensions.  Reported by
	Steven Wu.

2007-03-08  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* struct.c, struct.h (scm_make_vtable): New function, providing
	`make-vtable'.
	* stacks.c (scm_init_stacks): Use it.

2007-03-06  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* struct.c (scm_make_struct): Check for R,W,O at end of layout when
	allocating a tail array.  If there's no such then those tail fields
	are uninitialized and garbage SCMs there can cause a segv if printed
	(after fetching with struct-ref).

2007-02-22  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* scmsigs.c (scm_sleep): In docstring, cross refence usleep.
	(scm_usleep): Update docstring per manual, cross reference sleep.

	* struct.c (scm_make_struct): Move SCM_CRITICAL_SECTION_END up so that
	scm_struct_init is not within that section.  scm_struct_init can
	thrown an error, which within a critical section results in an
	abort().

2007-02-19  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	* Makefile.am (noinst_HEADERS): Add private-options.h, so that it
	is included in the distribution.
	(noinst_HEADERS): And the same for eval.i.c.

2007-01-31  Ludovic Courtès  <ludovic.courtes@laas.fr>

	* i18n.c: Include "libguile/threads.h" and "libguile/posix.h"
	unconditionally.  Include <langinfo.h> and <nl_types.h> when
	available.
	(SCM_I18N_STRINGIFY, SCM_LOCALE_CATEGORY_MASK,
	SCM_LIST_OR_INTEGER_P): New macros.
	(LC_*_MASK): When `USE_GNU_LOCALE_API' is undefined, define them
	as powers of two instead of `(1 << LC_*)'.
	(scm_i_locale_free): New function/macro.
	(scm_global_locale): New global variable.
	(smob_locale_free): Use `scm_i_locale_free ()'.
	(smob_locale_mark): Check whether the SMOB is `%global-locale'.
	(get_current_locale_settings): Return `EINVAL' instead of `errno'
	when `setlocale' fails.
	(restore_locale_settings): Likewise.
	(install_locale_categories): Likewise.
	(install_locale): Likewise.  Stop the locale stack traversal when
	all categories have been handled.
	(get_current_locale, category_to_category_mask,
	category_list_to_category_mask): New function.
	(scm_make_locale): Use them.  Accept both lists of `LC_*' values
	and single `LC_*' values as the first argument.  Handle the case
	where BASE_LOCALE is `%global-locale'.  When `USE_GNU_LOCALE_API',
	duplicate C_BASE_LOCALE before using it.
	(scm_nl_langinfo, define_langinfo_items): New functions.
	(scm_init_i18n): When `HAVE_NL_LANGINFO', add feature
	`nl-langinfo' and invoke `define_langinfo_items ()'.
	* i18n.h (scm_global_locale, scm_nl_langinfo): New declarations.
	* posix.c: Include <xlocale.h> when available.
	(scm_i_locale_mutex): Always define it.  Statically initialized.
	(scm_set_locale): Invoke `scm_i_to_lc_category ()' before
	acquiring the locale mutex.
	(scm_init_posix): No longer initialize SCM_I_LOCALE_MUTEX here.

2007-01-27  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* ports.c (scm_port_line, scm_set_port_line_x), read.c
	(scm_i_input_error, scm_lreadr, scm_lreadrecparen): Corrections to
	port line number type, should be "long" not "int", as per line_number
	field of scm_t_port.  (Makes a difference only on 64-bit systems, and
	only then for a linenum above 2Gig.)

2007-01-25  Han-Wen Nienhuys  <hanwen@lilypond.org>

	* vector.c: remove comment as per kryde's request.

2007-01-25  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* sort.c (scm_stable_sort): Return empty list for input empty list, as
	done in guile 1.6 and as always done by plain `sort'.  Was falling
	through to SCM_WRONG_TYPE_ARG.  Reported by Ales Hvezda.

2007-01-22  Han-Wen Nienhuys  <hanwen@lilypond.org>

	* vectors.c (s_scm_vector_move_right_x): complain about naming.

	* srcprop.c: regularize comments.

	* eval.c: remove superfluous ifndef DEVAL.

	* private-options.h: idem.

	* eval.i.c: copyright nitpicking.

	* eval.c: distangle. move duplicate code to eval.i.c and include
	twice.

	* eval.i.c: new file.

	* backtrace.c, debug.c, debug.h, deprecation.c, eq.c, eval.c
	eval.h, gsubr.c, init.c, macros.c, print.c, print.h, read.c,
	read.h, stacks.c, symbols.c, throw.c: use private-options.h

	* private-options.h: new file: contain hardcoded option
	definitions.

	* private-gc.h: add FSF header.

2007-01-19  Han-Wen Nienhuys  <hanwen@lilypond.org>

	* debug.h (SCM_RESET_DEBUG_MODE): switch to debugging if
	memoize-symbol is set.

	* eval.h (SCM_MEMOIZE_HDLR): add macros for memoize symbol trap.

	* eval.c (CEVAL): add memoize_symbol trap.

	* options.c (scm_options_try): new function. This allows error
	reporting before changing options in a critical section.

	* srcprop.c: use double cell for storing source-properties.  Put
	filename in the plist, and share between srcprops if possible.
	Remove specialized storage.

	* srcprop.h: remove macros without SCM_ prefix from
	interface. Remove specialized storage/type definitions.

	* read.c: idem.

	* print.c: idem.

	* eval.c: terminate option lists with 0.

	* options.c: remove n (for length) from scm_option_X
	functions. Detect option list length by looking for NULL name.

2007-01-19  Ludovic Courtès  <ludovic.courtes@laas.fr>

	* struct.c (scm_i_struct_equalp): Skip comparison if both FIELD1
	is equal to S1 and FIELD2 is equal to S2.  This avoids infinite
	recursion when comparing `s' fields, as the REQUIRED_VTABLE_FIELDS
	added by `make-vtable-vtable'.  Reported by Marco Maggi.

2007-01-18  Han-Wen Nienhuys  <hanwen@lilypond.org>

	* throw.c (scm_ithrow): more refined error message: print symbols
	too.

2007-01-16  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* feature.c, feature.h (scm_set_program_arguments_scm): New function,
	implementing `set-program-arguments'.

	* filesys.c (scm_init_filesys): Use scm_from_int rather than
	scm_from_long for O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, O_RDWR, O_CREAT, O_EXCL,
	O_NOCTTY, O_TRUNC, O_APPEND, O_NONBLOCK, O_NDELAY, O_SYNC and
	O_LARGEFILE.  These are all int not long, per arg to open().
	(scm_init_filesys): Use scm_from_int rather than scm_from_long for
	F_DUPFD, F_GETFD, F_SETFD, F_GETFL, F_SETFL, F_GETOWN, F_SETOWN, these
	are all ints (per command arg to fcntl).  Likewise FD_CLOEXEC which is
	an int arg to fcntl.

	* posix.c (scm_putenv): Correction to "len" variable, was defined only
	for __MINGW32__ but used under any !HAVE_UNSETENV (such as solaris).
	Move it to where it's used.  Reported by Hugh Sasse.

	* regex-posix.c (scm_regexp_exec): Remove SCM_CRITICAL_SECTION_START
	and SCM_CRITICAL_SECTION_END, believe not needed.  Their placement
	meant #\nul in the input (detected by scm_to_locale_string) and a bad
	flags arg (detected by scm_to_int) would throw from a critical
	section, causing an abort().

	* regex-posix.c (scm_init_regex_posix): Use scm_from_int for
	REG_BASIC, REG_EXTENDED, REG_ICASE, REG_NEWLINE, REG_NOTBOL,
	REG_NOTEOL; they're all ints not longs (per args to regcomp and
	regexec).

2007-01-10  Han-Wen Nienhuys  <hanwen@lilypond.org>

	* throw.c (scm_ithrow): print out key symbol and string arguments
	when error happens inside a critical section, and document why.

2007-01-06  Han-Wen Nienhuys  <hanwen@lilypond.org>

	* read.c (s_scm_read_hash_extend): document #f argument to
	read-hash-extend.

2007-01-04  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* deprecated.h (scm_create_hook), version.h.in (scm_major_version,
	scm_minor_version, scm_micro_version, scm_effective_version,
	scm_version, scm_init_version): Use SCM_API instead of just extern,
	for the benefit of mingw.  Reported by Cesar Strauss.

2007-01-03  Han-Wen Nienhuys  <hanwen@lilypond.org>

	* gc.c (s_scm_gc_stats): return an entry for total-cells-allocated
	too.
	(gc_update_stats): update scm_gc_cells_allocated_acc too.

2006-12-27  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* threads.c (get_thread_stack_base): In mingw with pthreads we can use
	the basic scm_get_stack_base.  As advised by Nils Durner.

	* threads.c (get_thread_stack_base): Add a version using
	pthread_get_stackaddr_np (when available), for the benefit of MacOS.
	As advised by Heikki Lindholm.

	* scmsigs.c (signal_delivery_thread): Restrict scm_i_pthread_sigmask
	to HAVE_PTHREAD_SIGMASK, it doesn't exist on mingw.  Reported by Nils
	Durner.

2006-12-24  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* posix.c (scm_kill): When only raise() is available, throw an ENOSYS
	error if pid is not our own process, instead of silently doing nothing.

	* print.c (scm_write, scm_display, scm_write_char): Disable port close
	on EPIPE.  This was previously disabled but introduction of HAVE_PIPE
	check in configure.in unintentionally enabled it.  Believe that
	testing errno after scm_prin1 or scm_putc is bogus, a long ago error
	can leave errno in that state.  popen.test "no duplicates" output test
	provoked that.

2006-12-23  Han-Wen Nienhuys  <hanwen@lilypond.org>

	* numbers.c (scm_i_fraction_reduce): move logic into
	scm_i_make_ratio(), so fractions are only read.
	scm_i_fraction_reduce() modifies a fraction when reading it.  A
	race condition might lead to fractions being corrupted by reading
	them concurrently.

	Also, the REDUCED bit alters the SCM_CELL_TYPE(), making
	comparisons between reduced and unreduced fractions go wrong.

	* numbers.h: remove SCM_FRACTION_SET_NUMERATOR,
	SCM_FRACTION_SET_DENOMINATOR, SCM_FRACTION_REDUCED_BIT,
	SCM_FRACTION_REDUCED_SET, SCM_FRACTION_REDUCED_CLEAR,
	SCM_FRACTION_REDUCED.

2006-12-16  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* scmsigs.c (scm_raise): Use raise() rather than kill(), as this is
	more direct for a procedure called raise.
	(kill): Remove mingw fake fallback.

2006-12-15  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* scmsigs.c: Conditionalize process.h, add io.h believe needed for
	_pipe on mingw.

2006-12-14  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* threads.c (thread_print): Cope with the case where pthread_t is a
	struct, as found on mingw.  Can't just cast to size_t for printing.
	Reported by Nils Durner.

	* scmsigs.c: Add <fcntl.h> and <process.h> needed by mingw.  Copy the
	fallback pipe() using _pipe() from posix.c.  Reported by Nils Durner.

2006-12-13  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* eval.c (scm_m_define): Set 'name procedure property on any
	scm_procedure_p, not just SCM_CLOSUREP.  In particular this picks up
	procedures with setters as used in srfi-17.

	* posix.c (scm_crypt): Check for NULL return from crypt(), which the
	linux man page says is a possibility.

2006-12-12  Ludovic Courtès  <ludovic.courtes@laas.fr>

	* libguile/unif.c (read_decimal_integer): Let RESP be SIGN * RES
	instead of RES (reported by Szavai Gyula).  This allows the use of
	negative lower bounds.
	(scm_i_read_array): Make sure LEN is non-negative (reported by
	Szavai Gyula).

	(scm_array_in_bounds_p): Iterate over S instead of always
	comparing indices with the bounds of S[0].  This fixes
	`array-in-bounds?' for arrays with a rank greater than one and
	with different lower bounds for each dimension.

2006-12-05  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* numbers.c (scm_product): For flonum*inum and complex*inum, return
	exact 0 if inum==0.  Already done for inum*flonum and inum*complex,
	and as per R5RS section "Exactness".

2006-12-03  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* Makefile.am (.c.doc): Remove the "test -n" apparently attempting to
	allow $AWK from the environment to override.  It had syntax gremlins,
	and the presence of a $(AWK) variable set by AC_PROG_AWK in the
	Makefile stopped it having any effect.  Use just $(AWK), which can be
	overridden with "make AWK=xxx" in the usual way if desired.

2006-11-29  Ludovic Courtès  <ludovic.courtes@laas.fr>

	* libguile/vectors.c (scm_vector_to_list): Fixed list
	construction: elements were not copied when INC is zero (see
	"shared array" example in `vectors.test').  Reported by
	Szavai Gyula.

2006-11-18  Ludovic Courtès  <ludovic.courtes@laas.fr>

	* Makefile.am (lib_LTLIBRARIES): Added `libguile-i18n-v-XX.la'.
	(libguile_la_SOURCES): Added `gettext.c', removed `i18n.c'.
	(libguile_i18n_v_XX_la_SOURCES, libguile_i18n_v_XX_la_CFLAGS,
	libguile_i18n_v_XX_la_LIBADD, libguile_i18n_v_XX_la_LDFLAGS): New.
	(DOT_X_FILES): Added `gettext.x'.
	(DOT_DOC_FILES): Likewise.
	(EXTRA_libguile_la_SOURCES): Added `locale-categories.h'.
	(modinclude_HEADERS): Added `gettext.h'.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Added `libgettext.h'.

	* gettext.h: Renamed to...
	* libgettext.h: New file.

	* i18n.c: Renamed to...
	* gettext.c: New file.

	* i18n.h: Renamed to...
	* gettext.h: New file.

	* i18n.c, i18n.h, locale-categories.h: New files.

	* init.c: Include "libguile/gettext.h" instead of
	"libguile/i18n.h".
	(scm_i_init_guile): Invoke `scm_init_gettext ()' instead of
	`scm_init_i18n ()'.

	* posix.c: Include "libguile/gettext.h" instead of
	"libguile/i18n.h"  Test `HAVE_NEWLOCALE' and `HAVE_STRCOLL_L'.
	(USE_GNU_LOCALE_API): New macro.
	(scm_i_locale_mutex): New variable.
	(scm_setlocale): Lock and unlock it around `setlocale ()' calls.

	* posix.h: Include "libguile/threads.h".
	(scm_i_locale_mutex): New declaration.

2006-11-17  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	* script.c (scm_shell_usage): Note need for subscription to bug-guile@gnu.org.

2006-11-08  Ludovic Courtès  <ludovic.courtes@laas.fr>

	* libguile/gc-freelist.c (scm_i_adjust_min_yield): Take two
	"sweep_stats" arguments; use them instead of accessing the global
	variables `scm_gc_cells_collected' and `scm_gc_cells_collected_1'.

	* libguile/gc-segment.c (scm_i_sweep_some_cards): Reset SWEEP
	before each iteration of the loop.
	(scm_i_sweep_some_segments): Reset SWEEP at each iteration.
	(scm_i_get_new_heap_segment): Take an additional argument
	SWEEP_STATS.  Compute MIN_CELLS as a function of it.

	* libguile/gc.c (scm_gc_cells_collected,
	scm_gc_cells_collected_1): Removed.
	(scm_i_gc_sweep_stats, scm_i_gc_sweep_stats_1): New.
	(scm_gc_cells_marked_acc, scm_gc_cells_swept_acc,
	scm_gc_time_taken, scm_gc_mark_time_taken, scm_gc_times,
	scm_gc_cell_yield_percentage, protected_obj_count): Made `static'.
	(scm_gc_stats): Use `scm_i_gc_sweep_stats' instead of
	`scm_gc_cells_(collected|swept)'.
	(gc_update_stats): New.
	(gc_end_stats): Use `scm_i_gc_sweep_stats' and
	`scm_i_gc_sweep_stats_1' instead of the former globals.
	(scm_gc_for_newcell): Invoke `gc_update_stats ()' after each
	`scm_i_sweep_some_segments' call.  This fixes a bug where the GC
	would keep allocating new segments instead of re-using collected
	cells (because `scm_gc_cells_collected' would remain zero).

	* libguile/gc.h (scm_gc_cells_swept, scm_gc_cells_collected,
	scm_gc_cell_yield_percentage): Removed.

	* libguile/private-gc.h (scm_gc_cells_collected_1): Removed.

	scm_init_environments() calls.

	* Makefile.am (libguile_la_SOURCES): Remove environments.c.
	(DOT_X_FILES): Remove environments.x.

	implementations for Linux and HP-UX.

	* coop-pthreads.c (SCM_MARK_BACKING_STORE): Use scm_ia64_ar_bsp()
	and scm_ia64_register_backing_store_base() instead of
	Linux-specific implementations.

	* continuations.h (__libc_ia64_register_backing_store_base):
	Declaration removed.
	(scm_t_contregs): New "fresh" field.

	* continuations.c (ia64_getcontext): Removed.
	(scm_make_continuation): Use continuation fresh field instead of
	interpreting getcontext return values (which isn't portable).  Use
	scm_ia64_ar_bsp() and scm_ia64_register_backing_store_base()
	instead of Linux-specific implementations.
	(copy_stack_and_call): Use scm_ia64_register_backing_store_base()
	instead of Linux-specific implementation.

	* _scm.h (__ia64__): Also detect __ia64.

2006-10-03  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* eval.c (SCM_APPLY): For scm_tc7_subr_2o, throw wrong-num-args on 0
	arguments or 3 or more arguments.  Previously 0 called proc with
	SCM_UNDEFINED, and 3 or more silently used just the first 2.

2006-09-28  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* fports.c, ports.c (ftruncate): Use "HAVE_CHSIZE && ! HAVE_FTRUNCATE"
	for chsize fallback, instead of hard-coding mingw.  Mingw in fact
	supplies ftruncate itself these days.

	* ports.c (fcntl.h): Can include this unconditionally, no need for
	__MINGW32__.

	* ports.c (truncate): Conditionalize on "HAVE_FTRUNCATE && !
	HAVE_TRUNCATE" so as not to hard-code mingw.  Use "const char *" and
	"off_t" for parameters, per usual definition of this function, rather
	than "char *" and "int".  Use ftruncate instead of chsize.  Check for
	error on final close.

2006-09-27  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* numbers.c (scm_log10): Check HAVE_CLOG10, clog10() is not available
	in mingw.

	* posix.c (scm_execl, scm_execlp, scm_execle): Cast "const char *
	const *" for mingw to suppress warnings from gcc (which are errors
	under the configure default -Werror).  Reported by Nils Durner.

2006-09-26  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* _scm.h (scm_to_off64_t, scm_from_off64_t): New macros.
	* fports.c (scm_open_file): Use open_or_open64.
	(fport_seek_or_seek64): New function, adapting fport_seek.
	* fports.c, fports.h (scm_i_fport_seek, scm_i_fport_truncate): New
	functions.
	* ports.c (scm_seek, scm_truncate_file): Use scm_i_fport_seek and
	scm_i_fport_truncate to allow 64-bit seeks and truncates on fports.

	CSET_LETTER_AND_DIGIT_PRED, CSET_GRAPHIC_PRED, CSET_PRINTING_PRED,
	CSET_TRUE_PRED, CSET_FALSE_PRED, UPDATE_CSET): New macros.
	(define_charset, scm_srfi_14_compute_char_sets): New functions.
	(scm_init_srfi_14): Use `define_charset ()' instead of
	`define_predset ()' and `define_strset ()'.

	* srfi-14.h (scm_c_init_srfi_14): Removed.
	(scm_srfi_14_compute_char_sets): New declaration.

	* posix.h: Include "srfi-14.h".
	(scm_setlocale): Invoke `scm_srfi_14_compute_char_sets ()' after a
	successful `setlocale ()' call.

2006-09-08  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	New, set from configure.
	* gen-scmconfig.c (SCM_NEED_BRACES_ON_PTHREAD_ONCE_INIT): New output
	to scmconfig.h.

	SCM_NEED_BRACES_ON_PTHREAD_ONCE_INIT to cope with Solaris.
	Reported by Claes Wallin.

2006-08-11  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	* stacks.c (scm_last_stack_frame): Correct docstring (returns a
	frame, not a stack).

2006-07-25  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* threads.c (get_thread_stack_base): Restrict HAVE_PTHREAD_GETATTR_NP
	on pthreads version, since pthread_getattr_np not available on solaris
	and macos.  Reported by Claes Wallin.

2006-07-24  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* filesys.c (dirfd): Test with #ifndef rather than HAVE_DIRFD, since
	it's a macro on MacOS X.  Reported by Claes Wallin.

	* posix.c (sethostname): Give prototype if not HAVE_DECL_SETHOSTNAME,
	for the benefit of Solaris 10.  Reported by Claes Wallin.

	* socket.c (scm_htonl, scm_ntohl): Use scm_to_uint32 rather than
	NUM2ULONG, to enforce 32-bit range check on systems with 64-bit long.

2006-07-21  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* eval.c, filesys.c (alloca): Update <alloca.h> etc blob, per current
	autoconf recommendation.  Should fix Solaris 10 reported by Claes
	Wallin.

	* threads.c: Include <string.h>, needed for memset() which is used by
	FD_ZERO() on Solaris 10.  Reported by Claes Wallin.

2006-07-18  Rob Browning  <rlb@defaultvalue.org>

	* continuations.c: Add __attribute__ ((returns_twice)) to the
	ia64_getcontext prototype so that gcc will make the right
	arrangements and avoid an illegal instruction during
	call-with-current-continuation.

2006-07-12  Ludovic Courtès <ludovic.courtes@laas.fr>

	* numbers.c (guile_ieee_init): Use regular ANSI C casts rather
	than C++-style `X_CAST ()'.  Patch posted by by Mike Gran.

2006-07-08  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* environments.c (core_environments_unobserve): Use if/else rather
	than ?: for "SET" bits, avoiding complaints from AIX xlc compiler
	about them not being rvalues.  Reported by Mike Gran.

	* Makefile.am (version.h): Don't use $< in an explicit rule, it's not
	portable and in particular fails on OpenBSD and AIX (see autoconf
	manual too).  Reported by Mike Gran.

2006-06-25  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* stime.c (bdtime2c): tm_gmtoff is seconds East, so take negative of
	tm:gmtoff which is seconds West.  Reported by Aaron VanDevender.
	(bdtime2c): Test HAVE_STRUCT_TM_TM_GMTOFF for tm_gmtoff, rather than
	HAVE_TM_ZONE.
	(scm_strptime): Use tm_gmtoff from the strptime result when that field
	exists, it's set by glibc strptime "%s".

2006-06-13  Ludovic Courtès <ludovic.courtes@laas.fr>

	* eq.c: Include "struct.h", "goops.h" and "objects.h".
	(scm_equal_p): Invoke `scm_i_struct_equalp ()' on structures that
	are not GOOPS instances.
	* struct.c: Include "eq.h".

	hand-written code.
	(scm_i_struct_equalp): New.
	* struct.h (scm_i_struct_equalp): New declaration.

2006-06-06  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* Makefile.am (BUILT_SOURCES): Remove guile.texi, only used by
	maintainers (with doc/maint/docstring.el).  Fixes parallel "make -j2"
	reported by Mattias Holm.

2006-06-03  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* read.c (s_vector): Conditionalize on SCM_ENABLE_ELISP, to avoid
	unused variable warning when elisp disabled.  Reported by Ryan
	VanderBijl.

	* throw.c (scm_handle_by_message): Add dummy return value to avoid
	compiler warning on cygwin.  Reported by Ryan VanderBijl.

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DOT_X_FILES): Typo in dependency rule, was a
	duplicate of EXTRA_DOT_DOC_FILES.
	(DOT_X_FILES, EXTRA_DOT_X_FILES, DOT_DOC_FILES, EXTRA_DOT_DOC_FILES):
	Add scmconfig.h to dependencies, since these all run cpp.  Helps a
	parallel "make -j2".  Reported by Mattias Holm.

2006-05-30  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* ports.c, ports.h (scm_set_port_mark, scm_set_port_free,
	scm_set_port_print, scm_set_port_equalp, scm_set_port_flush,
	scm_set_port_end_input, scm_set_port_close, scm_set_port_seek,
	scm_set_port_truncate, scm_set_port_input_waiting): Use scm_t_bits for
	port type descriptor, same as scm_make_port_type return value.

2006-05-30  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	* eq.c (scm_equal_p): Use scm_array_equal_p explicitely when one
	of the arguments is a array.  This allows vectors to be equal to
	one-dimensional arrays.

2006-05-29  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	* throw.c (scm_ithrow): When looking for the jmpbuf, first test
	that we have a pair before accessing its cdr.  Thanks to Bill
	Schottstaedt!

2006-05-28  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* eval.c, filesys.c: Add malloc.h to get alloca() on mingw.  Reported
	by "The Senator".

2006-05-27  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	* srfi-4.c, strings.c: Replace SCM_C_INLINE with
	SCM_C_INLINE_KEYWORD.  Thanks to Mark Gran!

2006-05-26  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* fports.c (fport_input_waiting): For ioctl, check HAVE_IOCTL as well
	as defined(FIONREAD), since mingw has FIONREAD but not ioctl().
	Reported by "The Senator".
	For select and ioctl, move fdes into those conditionals, to avoid
	unused variable warning when neither of those used.

2006-05-23  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* fports.c: Remove "fwrite" declaration under "! HAVE_UNISTD_H".
	It's unused and will be in stdio.h anyway (if it's anywhere).

2006-05-20  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* filesys.c (scm_stat2scm): Test #ifdef S_ISLNK directly, rather than
	HAVE_S_ISLNK from configure (it was only a #ifdef test anyway).

	* posix.c (scm_mknod): Test #ifdef S_IFLNK before using that (for
	symlink).  Probably can't create symlinks with mknod anyway though.

	* inline.h (scm_is_pair): Add a workaround for i386 gcc 2.95 bad code
	generation.

2006-05-15  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* simpos.c, simpos.h (scm_primitive__exit): New function.
	(scm_primitive_exit): Update docstring, no longer the best exit after
	a fork.

2006-05-09  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* numbers.c (scm_i_divide): For big/big wanting inexact, use mpq_get_d
	rather than converting to doubles, to avoid inf or nan when the inputs
	are too big for a double but the quotient does fit.  This affects
	conversions exact->inexact of big fractions.

	* filesys.c (scm_open_fdes): Use open64.
	(scm_init_filesys): Add O_LARGEFILE.

	* ports.c (scm_seek): Use lseek64.
	(scm_truncate_file): Use ftruncate64.

2006-05-08  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	* private-gc.h (CELL_P): Also check that the potential pointer is
	correctly aligned for a cell.  Thanks to Miroslav Lichvar!

2006-04-18  Rob Browning  <rlb@defaultvalue.org>

	* _scm.h: Add back error if the size of off_t is unknown.  The bug
	was actually in guile-readline's configuration.

2006-04-18  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* posix.c (scm_mkstemp): Update docstring from the manual, in
	particular file mode 0600 is not guaranteed.

2006-04-17  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* _scm.h (scm_to_off_t, scm_from_off_t): No error if unknown off_t
	size, to help the guile-readline build where off_t is unused.

2006-04-16  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* filesys.c (scm_stat2scm, scm_stat, scm_lstat): Use stat or stat64.
	(scm_readdir): Use readdir64.
	(scm_copy_file): Use open64 and fstat64, to cope with >2Gb files.
	* ports.c (scm_truncate_file): Use truncate64.  Correction truncate
	and ftruncate take off_t not size_t.
	* _scm.h (stat_or_stat64 etc): Macros for selecting LFS64 when
	available.

2006-04-06  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* fports.c (scm_setvbuf): Fix for not _IOLBF, clear SCM_BUFLINE
	instead of toggling it.  Reported by Ludovic Courtès.

2006-03-26  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	* threads.c (get_thread_stack_base): Use scm_get_stack_base
	instead of accessing __libc_stack_end directly, and only do this
	when pthread_attr_getstack is known not to work for the main
	thread or when not using pthreads at all.

	* gc_os_dep.c (scm_get_stack_base): Abort when the machine type is
	unknown instead of returning NULL.

2006-03-21  Ludovic Courtès  <ludovic.courtes@laas.fr>

        * numbers.c (scm_i_mem2number): Renamed to
	scm_c_locale_stringn_to_number.
	* numbers.c, print.c, read.c: Updated callers.
        * numbers.h: Update function declaration.

2006-03-11  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	* unif.c (string_set): Don't return in a void function.  (Reported
	by Mike Gran.)

	* srfi-4.c (scm_uniform_vector_read_x): Declare base as char*
	rather than void*, so we can do pointer arithmetic on it.
	(Reported by Mike Gran.)
	(s_scm_uniform_vector_write): Ditto.

2006-03-10  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	* unif.c (scm_make_shared_array): Don't use SCM_I_ARRAY_BASE when
	oldra is not an array.  (Reported by Steve Juranich.)

	* threads.c (do_unlock): Renamed from "unlock", which is defined
	in unistd.h on QNX.  (Reported by Matt Kraai.)

2006-03-04  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* deprecated.c (scm_i_defer_ints_etc): Show SCM_DEFER_INTS in message,
	not SCM_CRITICAL_SECTION_START.

	Mike Gran.

2006-02-28  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	NAME_MAX is not available, which is so on Solaris 10.  Report and help
	by Bill Schottstaedt.

	(scm_string_compare, scm_string_compare_ci, scm_string_lt,
	scm_string_gt, scm_string_le, scm_string_ge, scm_string_ci_lt,
	scm_string_ci_gt, scm_string_ci_le, scm_string_ci_ge): In comparisons
	use "unsigned char", not signed char.  This ensures comparisons are
	the same as `char<?' etc, and is also the same as guile 1.6 did.
	Reported by Sven Hartrumpf.

2006-02-19  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@neurologic.cc>

	* random.c: Test for SCM_HAVE_T_UINT64 instead of
	SCM_HAVE_T_INT64.
	(scm_i_uniform32, scm_i_uniform32, scm_i_init_rstate): Use
	scm_t_uint64 and scm_t_uint32 instead of scm_t_int64 and
	scm_t_int32.

2006-01-04  Ludovic Courtès  <ludovic.courtes@laas.fr>

        * gc-segment.c (scm_i_sweep_some_cards): Take a SWEEP_STATS
        argument.  Don't refer to SCM_GC_CELLS_COLLECTED and
        SCM_CELLS_ALLOCATED.  If SEG->FIRST_TIME, let CELLS_COLLECTED as zero.
        Take into account SEG->SPAN when computing CELLS_SWEPT.
        (scm_i_sweep_segment): Take one more argument, similarly.
        (scm_i_sweep_all_segments): Likewise.
        (scm_i_sweep_some_segments): Likewise.
        (scm_i_adjust_min_yield): Change the way MIN_CELLS is computed: do not
        refer to SCM_GC_CELLS_COLLECTED.

        * gc-freelist.c (scm_i_adjust_min_yield): Take one more
        argument, an `scm_i_sweep_statistics' object.
        Change the way DELTA is collected: don't take into account
        SCM_GC_CELLS_COLLECTED_1, only SWEEP_STATS.COLLECTED.

        * gc-malloc.c (scm_realloc): Pass an extra argument
        to `scm_i_sweep_all_segments ()'.

        * gc.c (gc_start_stats): Updated accordingly.
        (gc_end_stats): Take an additional SWEEP_STATS argument.
        Decrement SCM_CELLS_ALLOCATED after calls to `scm_i_sweep_* ()'.
        (scm_gc_for_newcell): Updated callers of `scm_i_sweep_*'.
        Decrement SCM_CELLS_ALLOCATED.
        (scm_i_gc): Likewise.

2006-02-14  Ludovic Courtès  <ludovic.courtes@laas.fr>

        * strings.c (scm_i_take_stringbufn): Register LEN+1 bytes instead of
	LEN.  Without this, too much collectable memory gets unregistered,
	which results in an underflow of SCM_MALLOCATED in
	`decrease_mtrigger()'.

        * gc-malloc.c (decrease_mtrigger): Make sure SIZE is lower than or
	equal to SCM_MALLOCATED.

2006-02-13  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	* eval.c (scm_eval_body): Use scm_i_dynwind_pthread_mutex_lock
	oinstead of scm_dynwind_pthread_mutex_lock so that it works when
	configured --without-threads.
	(SCM_APPLY, CEVAL): Likewise.  Thanks to Han-Wen Nienhuys!

2006-02-12  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	* unif.c (scm_dimensions_to_uniform_array): Use the prototype for
	filling when the fill parameter is omitted, as documented, but
	turn #\nul into 0 since s8 arrays (signified by a #\nul prototype)
	can not store characters.

2006-02-09  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	* socket.c (scm_c_make_socket_address): Pass address_size pointer
	on to scm_fill_sockaddr call.

2006-02-04  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	* throw.h (scm_c_catch, scm_c_with_throw_handler,
	scm_catch_with_pre_unwind_handler, scm_with_throw_handler): New.

	* throw.c (SCM_JBPREUNWIND, SCM_SETJBPREUNWIND): New.
	(struct pre_unwind_data): New, replaces struct lazy_catch.
	(scm_c_catch): New, replaces scm_internal_catch as the primary
	catch API for C code; adds pre-unwind handler support.
	(scm_internal_catch): Now just a wrapper for scm_c_catch, for back
	compatibility.
	(tc16_pre_unwind_data, pre_unwind_data_print,
	make_pre_unwind_data, SCM_PRE_UNWIND_DATA_P): Renamed from
	"lazy_catch" equivalents.
	(scm_c_with_throw_handler): New, replaces scm_internal_lazy_catch
	as the primary C API for a "lazy" catch.
	(scm_internal_lazy_catch): Now just a wrapper for
	scm_c_with_throw_handler, for back compatibility.
	(scm_catch_with_pre_unwind_handler): Renamed from scm_catch; adds
	pre-unwind handler support.
	(scm_catch): Now just a wrapper for
	scm_catch_with_pre_unwind_handler, for back compatibility.
	(scm_with_throw_handler): New.
	(scm_lazy_catch): Update comment to say that the handler can
	return, and what happens if it does.
	(toggle_pre_unwind_running): New.
	(scm_ithrow): When identifying the throw target, take running
	flags into account.  In general, change naming of things from
	"lazy_catch" to "pre_unwind".  When throwing to a throw handler,
	don't unwind the dynamic context first.  Add dynwind framing to
	manage the running flag of a throw handler.  If a lazy catch or
	throw handler returns, rethrow the same exception again.  Add
	pre-unwind support to the normal catch case (SCM_JMPBUFP).

	* root.c (scm_internal_cwdr): Add NULL args to
	scm_i_with_continuation_barrier call.

	* dynwind.c: Change comment mentioning lazy-catch to mention
	pre-unwind data and throw handler also.

	pre-unwind handler args.

	* continuations.c (scm_i_with_continuation_barrier): Add
	pre-unwind handler args, and pass on to scm_c_catch (changed from
	scm_internal_catch).
	(c_handler): Remove scm_handle_by_message_noexit call.
	(scm_c_with_continuation_barrier): Call
	scm_i_with_continuation_barrier with scm_handle_by_message_noexit
	as the pre-unwind handler.
	(scm_handler): Remove scm_handle_by_message_noexit call.
	(s_scm_with_continuation_barrier): Call
	scm_i_with_continuation_barrier with scm_handle_by_message_noexit
	as the pre-unwind handler.

2006-02-04  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* gc-mark.c (scm_mark_all): Fix c99-isms "loops" and "again" variables.

2006-02-03  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* list.c, list.h (scm_list): Restore this function for use from C.
	It's a complete no-op but in theory might used by someone.

2006-01-30  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	* eval.c (scm_eval_body): Lock source_mutex with a dynwind context
	so that it gets unlocked in all cases.
	(SCM_APPLY, CEVAL): Likewise.

2006-01-29  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	* ramap.c: (scm_array_map_x): Don't use scm_array_p, use
	scm_is_typed_array instead.

	Renamed the "frames" that are related to dynamic-wind to "dynamic
	contexts.  Renamed all functions from scm_frame_ to scm_dynwind_.
	Updated documentation.

	Disabled "futures":

	* futures.h, futures.c: Wrap whole contents in "#if 0"/"#endif".
	* eval.c, init.c: Comment out all 'future' related things.

2006-01-28  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	* inline.h, pairs.c (scm_is_pair): Moved scm_is_pair from pairs.c
	to inline.h to make it inline.

2005-12-19  Ludovic Courtès  <ludovic.courtes@laas.fr>

        * strings.c (scm_i_take_stringbufn): New.
        (scm_i_c_take_symbol): New.
        (scm_take_locale_stringn): Use `scm_i_take_stringbufn ()'.

        * strings.h (scm_i_c_take_symbol): New.
        (scm_i_take_stringbufn): New.

        * symbols.c  (lookup_interned_symbol): New function.
        (scm_i_c_mem2symbol): New function.
        (scm_i_mem2symbol): Use `lookup_symbol ()'.
        (scm_from_locale_symbol): Use `scm_i_c_mem2symbol ()'.  This avoids
        creating a new Scheme string.
        (scm_from_locale_symboln): Likewise.
        (scm_take_locale_symbol): New.
        (scm_take_locale_symboln): New.

        (scm_take_locale_symboln): New.

2006-01-18  Han-Wen Nienhuys  <hanwen@xs4all.nl>

	* gc-card.c ("sweep_card"): don't count scm_tc_free_cell for
	free_count.

2005-11-29  Han-Wen Nienhuys  <hanwen@xs4all.nl>

	* regex-posix.c (s_scm_regexp_exec): list the offending pattern
	upon error

	* load.c (the_reader, the_reader_fluid_num): New.
	(scm_primitive_load): Support custom reader.
	(scm_init_load): Init the_reader and the_reader_fluid_num; export
	the_reader as `current-reader'.

	* scmsigs.c (do_read_without_guile): Use the "raw_data" passed in
	(rather than an uninitialized pointer on the stack).

2005-12-07  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	Reported by Bruce Korb:

	* init.c (invoke_main_func): Don't call exit here.  Throws that
	are only caught by scm_with_guile will bypass us and would cause
	scm_boot_guile to return erroneously.
	(scm_boot_guile): Expect scm_with_guile to return and call exit
	here, passing it an appropriate exit code.

	From Andy Wingo:

	* script.c (scm_find_executable): Compile fix -- fgetc returns an
	unsigned char cast to an int, or -1 for EOS.

2005-12-06  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	* srfi-4.h, srfi-4.c, srfi-4.i.c (take_uvec): Make BASE pointer

	(signal_delivery_thread): Use it instead of
	scm_leave_guile/read/scm_enter_guile.

	From Stephen Compall:

	* eval.c (scm_m_cond): Recognize SRFI 61 cond syntax.
	(CEVAL): Evaluate SRFI 61 cond clauses.

2005-12-06  Ludovic Courtès  <ludovic.courtes@laas.fr>

	* gc-card.c (scm_i_card_statistics): Return if BITVEC is NULL.
	This was typically hit when running `gc-live-object-stats' right
	after starting Guile.

2005-11-30  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* srfi-13.c (scm_string_append_shared): No copying if just one
	non-empty string in args.

2005-11-26  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* gc-mark.c (scm_mark_all): Change C++ comment to C comment.  Reported
	by Ludovic Courtès.

	* list.c (list): Should be "primitive" in SCM_SNARF_DOCS, not
	"register".

	* random.c (scm_i_copy_rstate, scm_c_make_rstate): Don't test for
	scm_malloc returning NULL, it never does that.
	* putenv.c (putenv): Likewise.

	* socket.c (scm_fill_sockaddr): Remove SCM_C_INLINE_KEYWORD, this is
	much too big to want to inline.

2005-11-17  Ludovic Courtès  <ludovic.courtes@laas.fr>

	* print.c (EXIT_NESTED_DATA): Before popping from the stack, reset
	the value at its top.  This fixes a reference leak.
	(PUSH_REF): Perform `pstate->top++' after calling
	`PSTATE_STACK_SET ()' in order to avoid undesired potential side
	effects.

2005-11-12  Ludovic Courtès  <ludovic.courtes@laas.fr>

	* gc.c (scm_weak_vectors): Removed.

2005-11-12  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* socket.c (scm_setsockopt): Missing @defvar in docstring.  Reported
	by Ludovic Courtès.

2005-11-07  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	* stime.c (scm_mktime): Use scm_frame_critical_section instead of
	SCM_CRITICAL_SECTION_START/END since the code inside the critical
	section might exit non-locally.

2005-11-04  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	* eval.c (sym_instead): New symbol.
	(ENTER_APPLY): Remove optional use of a continuation when making
	trap call.
	(scm_debug_opts): Change doc for 'cheap option to make clear that
	it is now obsolete.
	(CEVAL, SCM_APPLY): Remove optional use of a continuation when

	and return values using the values that the trap call handlers
	return.

	* debug.h (SCM_CHEAPTRAPS_P): Removed.

2005-10-27  Ludovic Courtès  <ludovic.courtes@laas.fr>

	* socket.c (scm_fill_sockaddr): No need to check NULL from scm_malloc.
	(scm_connect, scm_bind, scm_sendto): Accept sockaddr object.
	(scm_addr_vector): Renamed to _scm_from_sockaddr, update usages.
	(scm_from_sockaddr, scm_to_sockaddr, scm_make_socket_address,

	* socket.h: Add prototypes.

2005-10-24  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* socket.c (scm_init_socket): Add IPPROTO_IP, IPPROTO_TCP,
	IPPROTO_UDP.  Remove SOL_IP, SOL_TCP, SOL_UDP.  The former are in
	POSIX spec examples, the latter are not available on for instance
	NetBSD.

	* socket.c (scm_getsockopt, scm_setsockopt): Update docstrings from
	posix.texi.

	* stime.c (scm_strftime): Update docstring from posix.texi.

2005-10-23  Marius Vollmer  <marius.vollmer@uni-dortmund.de>

	PTHREAD_RECURSIVE_MUTEX_INITIALIZER_NP is not portable enough.

	* null-threads.h, pthread-threads.h
	(SCM_I_PTHREAD_RECURSIVE_MUTEX_INITIALIZER): Removed.
	(scm_i_pthread_mutexattr_recursive): New.

	* threads.c (scm_i_pthread_mutexattr_recursive): Declare.
	(scm_i_critical_section_mutex): Do not initialize statically.
	(scm_threads_prehistory): Initialize
	scm_i_pthread_mutexattr_recursive and scm_i_critical_section_mutex
	here.

2005-08-15  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	* eval.c (eval_letrec_inits): New.
	(CEVAL): Eval letrec initializer forms using eval_letrec_inits.

2005-08-12  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	* numbers.c: Use scm_from_bool instead of SCM_BOOL.  Thanks to
	Peter Gavin!

2005-08-12  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* srfi-13.c (scm_string_for_each_index): Correction to docstring.

2005-08-06  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* srfi-13.c (scm_string_any, scm_string_every, scm_string_tabulate,
	scm_string_trim, scm_string_trim_right, scm_string_trim_both,
	scm_string_index, scm_string_index_right, scm_string_skip,

	scm_string_map_x, scm_string_for_each, scm_string_for_each_index,
	scm_string_filter, scm_string_delete): Use scm_t_trampoline_1 for
	procedures called in loops.

2005-08-02  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* strports.c (st_flush): Increase buffer by 1.5x when growing, to
	avoid lots of copying where previoulsy growing by only 80 bytes at a
	time.

2005-08-01  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	* modules.h, modules.c (scm_eval_closure_module): Removed, we
	already have scm_lookup_closure_module, which does the same thing.

2005-08-01  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	New marking algorithm for weak hashtables that fixes the problem
	that references from the non-weak value to the associated weak
	key (for example) would prevent the entry from ever being dropped.

	Guardians have been changed back to their original semantics and
	are no longer greedy and no longer drop cycles.

	* gc-mark.c (scm_mark_all): Do not rely on hooks to run the weak
	hashtable and guardian machinery but call the relevant functions
	directly.

	* guardians.h, guardians.c, deprecated.h,
	deprecated.c (scm_destroy_guardian_x, scm_guardian_greedy_p,
	scm_guardian_destroyed_p, scm_guard, scm_get_one_zombie):
	Deprecated and moved into deprecated.[ch].

	* guardians.h, guardians.c: Mostly rewritten.
	(scm_i_init_guardians_for_gc,
	scm_i_identify_inaccessible_guardeds,
	scm_i_mark_inaccessible_guardeds): New.
	(scm_make_guardian): Removed greedy_p argument.

	* weaks.h, weaks.c (SCM_I_WVECT_TYPE, SCM_I_SET_WVECT_TYPE): New.
	(SCM_I_WVECT_N_ITEMS, SCM_I_SET_WVECT_N_ITEMS): New.
	(SCM_WVECTF_NOSCAN, SCM_WVECT_NOSCAN_P): Removed.
	(scm_weaks_prehistory): Removed.
	(scm_i_init_weak_vectors_for_gc, scm_i_mark_weak_vector,
	scm_i_mark_weak_vectors_non_weaks,

	(scm_weak_vector_gc_init, scm_mark_weak_vector_spines,
	scm_scan_weak_vectors): Removed.

	* hashtab.h (scm_i_scan_weak_hashtables): New.
	* hashtab.c (make_hash_table, scm_i_rehash): Do not use
	SCM_WVECTF_NOSCAN.
	(hashtable_print): Use SCM_HASHTABLE_N_ITEMS instead of
	t->n_items.
	(scan_weak_hashtables, scm_i_scan_weak_hashtables): Renamed former
	to latter.  Do not scan the alists themselves, this is done by the
	weak vector code now.  Just update the element count.

	* vectors.h (SCM_I_WVECT_TYPE, SCM_I_WVECT_EXTRA): Renamed former
	to latter.  The type is now only part of the cell word.
	(SCM_I_SET_WVECT_TYPE, SCM_I_SET_WVECT_EXTRA): Likewise.

	* init.c (scm_i_init_guile): Do not call scm_weaks_prehistory.

2005-07-18  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@d14n36.pdc.kth.se>

	Some changes towards making it possible to run Guile on the EM64T
	platform.

	* gc.c (scm_gc_stats): Bugfix: Measure size of the type we are
	mallocating for (unsigned long *bounds).

	* hashtab.c (scm_i_rehash): Cast SCM_HASHTABLE_FLAGS (table) to
	scm_t_bits before storing them in the type word.

	* gc.c (tag_table_to_type_alist): Modified type of c_tag from
	scm_t_bits to int.

2005-07-12  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* eval.c (scm_dbg_make_iloc): Should be SCM_IFRAMEMAX and
	SCM_IDISTMAX, and cast uints through scm_t_bits to make gcc happy.
	* pairs.c (scm_error_pair_access): Use scm_from_locale_string rather
	than scm_makfrom0str.
	Reported by Ken Raeburn.

	* gc-card.c (scm_dbg_gc_get_bvec): Change return from long* to
	scm_t_c_bvec_long*, gcc 4 doesn't like different pointer targets when
	returning SCM_GC_CARD_BVEC.

	* pairs.c (scm_error_pair_access): Plain ascii ' in error message
	rather than latin-1 acute accent, the latter may not print on all
	terminals.

	* srfi-13.c (scm_string_filter, scm_string_delete): Strip leading and
	trailing deletions, so as to return a substring if those are the only
	changes.

2005-07-10  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* socket.c (scm_inet_pton, scm_inet_ntop): Pointer cast to scm_t_uint8
	for scm ipv6 funcs, gcc 4 is picky about char* vs uchar*.
	(scm_getsockopt, scm_accept, scm_getsockname, scm_getpeername,
	scm_recvfrom) Use socklen_t, gcc 4 is picky about int* vs socklen_t*.

2005-07-01  Han-Wen Nienhuys  <hanwen@xs4all.nl>

	* gc-card.c (scm_i_card_statistics): init tag.

	* gc.c (tag_table_to_type_alist): check type of tag. Should be integer.

2005-06-18  Han-Wen Nienhuys  <hanwen@xs4all.nl>

	* fports.c (s_scm_open_file): add the b flag for binary to the doc
	string.

2005-06-25  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* srfi-13.c (scm_string_filter, scm_string_delete): Partial revert
	last change, use plain copy-on-write substrings, the individual
	descriptions in the srfi don't mention shared storage (only the
	introduction does).

	* strings.c (scm_take_locale_stringn): Use realloc to make room for
	null-terminator, rather than mallocing a whole new block.
	(scm_take_locale_string): Use scm_take_locale_stringn len==-1.

2005-06-12  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	* ramap.c (scm_array_index_map_x): First test for real arrays,
	then check for generalized vectors.  This ensures that the
	generalized vector case need only work with zero-origin ranges.
	(scm_ra_eqp, scm_ra_compare): Use the new array handle functions
	to access the target array, making these functions work with all
	kinds of arrays, not just bit arrays.

	* gh.h, gh_data.c, gh_eval.c, gh_funcs.c, gh_init.c, gh_io.c,
	gh_list.c, gh_predicates.c: Deprecated everything.

	* environments.c (environment_default_folder,
	environment_default_observer): Do not use gh_call3, gh_call1.

2005-06-10  Han-Wen Nienhuys  <hanwen@xs4all.nl>

	* modules.c (s_scm_eval_closure_module): new function. Return the
	module inside an eval-closure.

	* gc.c (scm_init_storage): make scm_stand_in_procs a weak_key hash
	table. This means that procedure properties are GC'd if the
	procedure dies.

2005-06-11  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* srfi-13.c (scm_string_filter, scm_string_delete): For char and
	charset cases, count chars kept and build a string in a second pass,
	rather than using a cons cell for every char kept.  Use a shared
	substring when nothing removed (such sharing is allowed by the srfi).

2005-06-09  Han-Wen Nienhuys  <hanwen@xs4all.nl>

	* gc.c (tag_table_to_type_alist): convert tag number to "tag %d"
	string, so live object stats can be sorted with string<?.

2005-06-06  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	* print.c (iprin1): When writing a string, collect all characters
	that can be printed directly into one call to scm_lfwrite.
	Previously, every character was output with its own call to
	write(2) on unbuffered ports.

	* eval.c (scm_eval_options_interface): Use
	scm_frame_critical_section instead of SCM_CRITICAL_SECTION_START
	and SCM_CRITICAL_SECTION_END.

	* unif.c (scm_array_in_bounds_p): First test for real arrays, then
	check for generalized vectors.  This ensures that the generalized
	vector case need only work with zero-origin ranges.

2005-06-06  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* srfi-13.c (scm_string_split): Compare char/char in scan.  Mixing an
	unsigned int SCM_CHAR and a char string meant an 8-bit char was never
	matched.

2005-06-05  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	* eval.c: Added comment on how to make case 1.1 of
	r5rs_pitfall.test succeed.

	From Jan Nieuwenhuizen <janneke@gnu.org>. Thanks!

 	* hashtab.h: Bugfix: use SCM_API (WAS: extern).

 	* socket.c: Remove obsolete comment about socklen_t.
 	(s_scm_setsockopt)[!HAVE_IP_MREQ]: Do not use ip_mreq code.

 	* numbers.h (isnan)[__MINGW32__]: Remove.

 	* Makefile.am (gen_scmconfig_SOURCES): Bugfix: Add
 	DEFAULT_INCLUDES when cross compiling.

 	* threads.c (ETIMEDOUT, pipe)[__MINGW32__]: Add defines.

 	* stime.c (scm_strftime)[!HAVE_TM_ZONE]: Use
	SCM_SIMPLE_VECTOR_REF instead of SCM_VELTS.  (Changed slightly
	from Jan's patch.)

2005-05-22  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	* unif.c (scm_make_shared_array): Add old base to new base since
	scm_array_handle_pos does not include the base.
	(scm_aind): Likewise.

	* ports.c (scm_putc, scm_puts): Assert that the port argument is a
	output port.

2005-05-12  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	Mac OS X compile warning fixes, reported by Richard Todd.

	* unif.c (scm_i_read_array): Declare rank as ssize_t, to guarantee
	that it is signed.

	(scm_mkstrport): Make read/write_buf cast unsigned.

	* srfi-13.c (string_titlecase_x): Add unsigned char cast.

	* rdelim.c (scm_read_line): Initialize slen.

	* load.c (scm_search_path): Remove weird >=1, and add
	parentheses to clarify conditions.

	* hash.c (scm_hasher): Add const unsigned char cast.

	* gh_data.c (gh_chars2byvect): Add scm_t_int8 cast.

2005-05-11  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	Fix C99isms reported by Ludovic Courtès:

	* threads.c (s_scm_lock_mutex): Don't declare msg in middle of

	of code.

	* gc-card.c (scm_i_card_statistics): Don't declare tag in middle
	of code.
	(scm_i_card_statistics): Add block for declarations of tag_as_scm
	and current.

2005-05-10  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	* scmsigs.c (signal_delivery_thread): Return a value, to avoid
	compile warning reported by Werner Scheinast.

2005-04-30  Han-Wen Nienhuys  <hanwen@xs4all.nl>

	* list.h: remove scm_list()

	* fluids.c (DYNAMIC_STATE_NEXT_LOC): new macro for use with
	SCM_DEBUG_CELL_ACCESSES
	(FLUID_NEXT_LOC): idem.

2005-04-30  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* numbers.c (scm_divide): Correction to 1/complex and <any>/complex,
	need to test abs(re)<abs(im) for choice of cases, otherwise divide by
	zero when re==0 and im<0.  Reported by Jean Crepeau.

2005-04-25  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* ramap.c (scm_array_map_x): Allow no source args, add num args checks
	to subr_1, subr_2, subr_2o and dsubr cases.  No source args only has a
	few sensible uses (like filling with a random number generator say),
	but has been allowed in the past and so should be kept.

2005-04-23  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* hashtab.c (scm_hashx_remove_x): Need to pass "closure" to
	scm_hash_fn_remove_x.

	* list.c (scm_cons_star): Don't modify the rest list, it belongs to
	the caller when cons* is reached through apply.

	* list.c (list): Use scm_list_copy, so as to produce a fresh list when
	list is called using apply, under the debugging evaluator.
	(scm_list): Remove.

	* list.c, list.h (scm_make_list): New code, moving make-list from
	boot-9.scm.

2005-04-14  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* numbers.c, numbers.h (scm_oneplus, scm_oneminus): New functions,
	converted from scheme code in boot-9.scm.

2005-04-11  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* srfi-13.c (scm_string_concatenate, scm_string_concatenate_shared):
	Validate list argument, scm_string_append and scm_string_append_shared
	don't do that to their rest argument (in a normal build).

2005-04-04  Marius Vollmer  <marius.vollmer@uni-dortmund.de>

	* hashtab.h, hashtab.c (scm_t_hashtable): Removed 'closure' field.  The
	closure can not be stored since it is no longer valid at GC time.
	(make_hash_table): Initialize 'hash_fn' field.
	(scm_i_rehash): Only store hash_fn in hash table when closre is
	NULL.
	(rehash_after_gc): Only call scm_i_rehash when 'hash_fn' is
	non-NULL.  Always use a NULL closure.
	(scm_hash_fn_create_handle_x): Also rehash when table contains too
	few entries.

2005-03-29  Marius Vollmer  <marius.vollmer@uni-dortmund.de>

	* hashtab.h, hashtab.c (scm_hash_fx_remove_x): Removed delete_fn
	argument; always use scm_delq_x.  The delete_fn function works on
	the handle, not the key, and it therefore makes no sense to make
	it configurable.  Changed all callers.
	(scm_hashx_remove_x): Likewise.  Also, exported to Scheme.
	(scm_hash_clear): Accept plain vectors as hashtables.
	(scm_delx_x): Removed.

2005-03-28  Han-Wen Nienhuys  <hanwen@xs4all.nl>

	* strings.h (SCM_STRING_UCHARS): Added missing argument.

2005-03-18  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* arbiters.c (FETCH_STORE) [generic C]: Should be
	scm_i_scm_pthread_mutex_lock/unlock now.  Reported by Ludovic Courtès.

	* numbers.c, numbers.h (scm_i_clonebig): Remove static, so can use in
	srfi-60.

	* numbers.c (scm_logior): Must scm_i_normbig results as per scm_logand,
	because OR-ing bits into a negative can reduce the value to an inum.

	* numbers.c (scm_num_eq_p): On 64-bit systems, be careful about
	casting inum to double since that can lose precision.

2005-03-10  Marius Vollmer  <marius.vollmer@uni-dortmund.de>

	* threads.h, threads.c (scm_i_thread): Added gc_running_p field.
	(guilify_self_1): Initialize it.

	(scm_gc_running_p): Now a macro that refers to the scm_i_thread
	field.
	(scm_i_sweep_mutex): Now a non-recursive mutex.  GC can not happen
	recursively.
	(scm_igc, scm_i_gc): Renamed former to latter.  Changed all uses.
	Do not lock scm_i_sweep_mutex, which is now non-recursive, or set
	scm_gc_running_p.  Do not run the scm_after_gc_c_hook.
	(scm_gc): Lock scm_i_sweep_mutex, set scm_gc_running_p and run the
	scm_after_gc_c_hook here.
	(scm_gc_for_new_cell): Set scm_gc_running_p here and run the
	scm_after_gc_c_hook when a full GC has in fact been performed.
	(scm_i_expensive_validation_check): Call scm_gc, not scm_i_gc.

	* gc-segment.c (scm_i_get_new_heap_segment): Do not check

	scm_gc_running_p while the scm_i_sweep_mutex is locked.

	* inline.h (scm_cell, scm_double_cell): Do not check
	scm_gc_running_p, allocation during sweeping is OK.

	* gdbint.c (SCM_BEGIN_FOREIGN_BLOCK, SCM_END_FOREIGN_BLOCK): Do
	not set scm_block_gc.

	* init.c (scm_i_init_guile): Do not set scm_block_gc.

	* deprecation.c (scm_c_issue_deprecation_warning): Use malloc
	instead of scm_malloc.  The latter can not be used during GC.

2005-03-09  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	* script.c (scm_compile_shell_switches): Added 2005 to Copyright
	years.

2005-03-09  Marius Vollmer  <marius.vollmer@uni-dortmund.de>

	* gc-card.c (scm_i_sweep_card): Do not increase/decrease
	scm_gc_running_p.  Sweeping can happen in parallel with
	allocation.

	* threads.h, threads.c (scm_i_frame_single_threaded): Removed.
	(scm_i_thread): Removed unused signal_asyncs field.

	simple things inside that region.
	 (scm_make_fluid, scm_make_dynamic_state): Lock fluid_admin_mutex
	while adding to the global lists.


2005-03-08  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	(libguile_la_LIBADD): Removed @LIBLTDL@.

2005-03-07  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	* threads.h, async.h, threads.c (SCM_CRITICAL_SECTION_START,
	SCM_CRITICAL_SECTION_END): Moved here from threads.h since now
	they also block/unblock execution of asyncs and call
	scm_async_click which is declared in async.h but threads.h can not
	include async.h since async.h already includes threads.h.
	(scm_i_critical_section_level): New, for checking mistakes in the
	use of the SCM_CRITICAL_SECTION_* macros.
	(scm_i_critical_section_mutex): Make it a recursive mutex so that
	critical sections can be nested.

2005-03-02  Marius Vollmer  <marius.vollmer@uni-dortmund.de>

	Big merge from the mvo-thread-cleanup branch. The main changes
	are:

	- The dynamic roots functionality has been split into dynamic
	  states and continuations barriers.  Fluids have been
	  reimplemented and can now be garbage collected.

	- Initialization of Guile now works in a multi-thread friendly
	  manner.  Threads can freely enter and leave guile mode.

	- Blocking on mutexes or condition variables or while selecting
	  can now be reliably interrupted via system asyncs.

	- The low-level threading interface has been removed.

	- Signals are delivered via a pipe to a dedicated 'signal delivery
	  thread'.

	- SCM_DEFER_INTS, SCM_ALLOW_INTS etc have been deprecated.

	scm_make_rec_mutex, with all the consequences.
	(scm_eval_x, scm_eval): Use scm_frame_begin etc instead of

2005-02-28  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	Thanks to Greg Troxel!

2005-02-27  Mikael Djurfeldt  <djurfeldt@nada.kth.se>

	* gh.h: Bugfix: Include <libguile.h> outside of the extern "C"
	block.

2005-02-25  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	so that no two weak alist vectors share a spine.
	(scm_hash_fn_create_handle_x): Deal with a possible rehashing
	during GC before inserting the new alist cell.

2005-02-23  Marius Vollmer  <marius.vollmer@uni-dortmund.de>

	* unif.c (prototype_to_type): Bugfix: Don't compare prototype to
	the prototypical examples mentioned in the old reference manual.
	Instead keep the old semantics of dispatching on type.  (Yes, this
	is extremely ugly, but the whole point of keeping the deprecated
	interface is not to break old code.)

2005-02-08  Mikael Djurfeldt  <djurfeldt@nada.kth.se>

	* deprecated.h (SCM_ARRAY_DIMS): Rename scm_i_attay_dims -->
	scm_i_array_dims.

2005-01-28  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* numbers.c (scm_ash): Rewrite using shifts, much faster than
	integer-expt and multiply/divide.  Inexacts and fractions no longer
	supported (they happened to work before for left shifts, but not
	right).  Don't really need inexacts and fractions, since ash is
	documented as a "bitwise operation", and all the rest of those only
	take exact integers.

2005-01-27  Han-Wen Nienhuys  <hanwen@xs4all.nl>

	* gc-card.c (scm_i_card_statistics): map structs, closures and

	statistics on the number of live objects of each type.

	* gc-card.c (scm_i_tag_name):  new function.
	(scm_i_card_statistics): new function.

2005-01-24  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* posix.c (scm_setlocale): Force errno=EINVAL for an error, since
	POSIX and C99 don't document errno being set.  Reported by Bruno

2004-11-12  Marius Vollmer  <marius.vollmer@uni-dortmund.de>

	Enclosed arrays are now their own smob.  This has been done to
	make the code more explicit about them and to prepare for the time
	when generalized vectors include arbitrary one-dimensional
	arrays. (Uptonow, enclosed arrays have been recognized by their
	use of an array as their storage 'vector'.  When all generalized
	vectors are allowed as storage, including one-dimensional arrays,
	this will no longer work.)

	* unif.h, unif.c: (scm_tc16_enclosed_array, SCM_ENCLOSED_ARRAYP):
	New.
	(exactly_one_third, singp): Removed.
	(scm_array_p, scm_array_dimensions, scm_shared_array_root,
	scm_shared_array_offset, scm_shared_array_increments): Handle
	enclosed arrays explicitely.
	(scm_array_rank): Likewise. Also, do not return zero for
	non-arrays, signal an error instead since arrays with rank zero do
	exist.

	(scm_make_enclosed_array): Use it.
	(scm_make_ra): Reimplemented in terms of scm_i_make_ra.

	(scm_cvref): Use scm_i_cvref.
	(scm_array_ref): Do not accept non-arrays when no indices are
	given. Use scm_i_cvref to do the actual access.
	("uniform-array-set1"): Do not register.
	(scm_array_set_x, scm_uniform_array_read_x,
	scm_uniform_array_write): Handle enclosed arrays explicitly.

	Added "a" and "b" for strings and bitvectors, resp.
	(scm_i_tag_to_prototype, scm_i_tag_to_creator): Renamed former to
	latter.  Tag "a" is in the table now, no need to handle it as a
	legacy tag.
	(scm_raprin1): Just call scm_iprin1.
	(scm_array_creator, scm_array_prototype): Handle enclosed arrays
	explicitly.
	(scm_init_unif): Initialize scm_tc16_enclosed_array smob.

	* ramap.c (cind): Changed second arg to be pointer to long instead
	of uniform vector.
	(scm_ramapc): Allocate index vector with scm_malloc and not as
	uniform vector.  Wrap it in a frame so that it gets properly freed.
	(scm_array_index_map_x): Likewise.

	* unif.c: Changed all uses of scm_array_prototype to
	scm_array_creator. (scm_i_get_old_prototype): Signal error when no
	prototype is known.
	(scm_uniform_array_read_x, scm_uniform_array_write): Reimplemented
	in terms of scm_uniform_vector_read_x and

	(scm_bit_count, scm_bit_position, scm_bit_set_star_x,
	scm_bit_count_star, scm_bit_invert_x, scm_istr2bve): Rewritten
	using the new C API for bitvectors and maybe count_ones or
	find_first_one, as appropriate.
	(SCM_I_MAX_LENGTH, SCM_BITVECTOR_P, SCM_BITVECTOR_BASE,
	SCM_SET_BITVECTOR_BASE, SCM_BITVECTOR_MAX_LENGTH,
	SCM_BITVECTOR_LENGTH, SCM_MAKE_BITVECTOR_TAG,

	first and the second line of the SCM_DEFINE macro call, since old
	preprocessors cannot handle definitions that are split into two
	lines.

	* inline.h (scm_cell, scm_double_cell): Don't use C99 variable
	declarations.

	* pairs.c (scm_i_chase_pairs): Replace scm_t_bits with

	* read.c (scm_lreadr): Call scm_i_read_array for all characters
	following '#' that can start an array.  Explicitely disambiguate
	'i' and 'e' between introducing numbers and uniform vectors.  Do

	by scm_i_read_array now.

2004-10-27  Marius Vollmer  <marius.vollmer@uni-dortmund.de>

	First cut at integrating uniform vectors from srfi-4 with the rest
	of Guile.  This change replaces scm_tc7_byvect with a s8 uniform
	vector.  The plan is to gradually replace one type after the other
	until none is left and then to consider general cleanups and
	optimizations.

	* srfi-4.h, srfi-4.i.c (scm_u8vector_elements, etc): New.

	(vector_scale_x, vector_sum_squares, scm_random_normal_vector_x):
	Do not use scm_universal_vector_length for non-uniform vectors.
	Use scm_f64vector_elements to access innards of uniform vectors.

	requested.
	* convert.c (scm_c_scm2chars, scm_c_chars2scm,

	* guile.c, dynl.c: Switched to using libltdl directly.  Replaced
	all references to scm_lt_* with just lt_*.  Include <ltdl.h>
	instead of <libguile-ltdl.h>.

2004-10-20  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	* sort.c (quicksort): Copy pivot out of the array while
	constructing the partitions; it could get overwritten otherwise.
	Because of the ultimate insertion sort, this bug did not cause
	quicksort to fail, it just put all the burdon on the insertion
	sort and was thus very slow.  Thanks to Rolan Orre for reporting
	the slowness!

2004-10-19  Marius Vollmer  <marius.vollmer@uni-dortmund.de>

	with scm_i_mode_bits to avoid accessing internals of SCM string
	from C.

	* ports.h (scm_i_mode_bits): New, same as scm_mode_bits but with a
	SCM string as argument.

	* ports.c (scm_i_void_port): New, like scm_void_port but take mode
	bits directly instead of C string.

	(scm_sys_make_void_port): Use scm_i_void_port together with
	scm_i_mode_bits to avoid accessing internals of SCM string.

	* strings.h, strings.c (scm_i_get_substring_spec): New.

	* socket.c, rw.c, deprecated.h, validate.h

	with more explicit scm_remember_upto_here_1, etc, or introduced
	them in the first place.

	* load.c (scm_primitive_load_path): Do not check for absolute
	filenames when scm_sys_search_load_path returns false, which will
	return absolute filenames unchanged.

2004-08-11  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	* gc.c, procprop.c (scm_init_storage, scm_stand_in_procs,
	scm_stand_in_proc): Use a hastable for scm_stand_in_procs instead

	(SCM_STRING_CHARS, SCM_STRING_UCHARS, SCM_STRING_LENGTH): Renamed
	to SCM_I_STRING_CHARS, SCM_I_STRING_UCHARS, and SCM_I_LENGTH
	respectively.  For a short time, the old names are still there as
	aliases.  Not all uses have been changed yet, but the ones in
	strings.c have.
	(SCM_STRING_MAX_LEN): Do not hardcode to 24 bits, compute from
	SCM_T_BITS_MAX.
	(scm_is_string, scm_from_locale_string, scm_from_locale_stringn,
	scm_take_locale_string, scm_take_locale_stringn,
	scm_to_locale_string, scm_to_locale_stringn,
	scm_to_locale_stringbuf): New.
	(scm_c_string2str, scm_c_substring2str): Deprecated by moving to
	deprecated.[hc]. Implemented in terms of the new functions above.
	(scm_take_str, scm_take0str, scm_mem2string, scm_str2string,

	* strop.c (scm_i_index): Replaced SCM_STRINGP, SCM_STRING_CHARS,
	and SCM_STRING_LENGTH with SCM_I_STRINGP, SCM_I_STRING_CHARS, and
	SCM_I_STRING_LENGTH, respectively.  Pass string object directly,
	not as a pointer.  Use scm_remember_upto_here_1 to protect it.

	* read.c (scm_input_error): Use a SCM value for 'fn', not a C
	string.  This avoids a conversion round-trip.

	* gh_data.c: Replaced SCM_STRINGP, SCM_STRING_CHARS, and

	terms of scm_to_locale_stringbuf and so that it is thread safe.

	* error.c (scm_error_scm): Throw directly instead of calling
	scm_error, this avoids the back and forth conversion of SUBR and
	MESSAGE and also plugs a memory leak.
	(scm_error): Call scm_error_scm.

	* backtrace.c: Replaced SCM_STRINGP with scm_is_string.
	(display_header): Print FNAME when it is true, not
	merely when it is a string.

	* strings.h (SCM_SET_STRING_LENGTH, SCM_SET_STRING_CHARS): Removed

	* net_db.c (scm_resolv_error): don't cause an exception while
	trying to throw an exception -- call scm_misc_error with correct
	arguments.  The previous arguments needed a format escape that
	wasn't in any of the format strings.

2004-08-06  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* ramap.c (scm_array_fill_x): For byvect char fill, force signed char
	so as not to depend on signedness of plain char.  For byvect range
	check, throw out-of-range rather than wrong-type-arg.

	* unif.c (scm_uniform_vector_ref, scm_array_set_x): For byvect, force
	signed byte range checks by using scm_to_schar and scm_from_schar,
	don't want to depend on signedness of C char.

2004-08-05  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* arbiters.c (scm_try_arbiter): Use scm_i_misc_mutex instead of

	(scm_release_arbiter): Use scm_i_misc_mutex so return value can be
	guaranteed if multiple threads compete to unlock.
	Update docstrings per doc/ref/api-scheduling.texi.

	* filesys.c (scm_copy_file): Use fstat on the input fd rather than
	stat on the filename, to be certain a file rename can't mean we get
	info on one filesystem object but open another.  This fstat usage is
	similar to Emacs copy-file.

	* posix.c (scm_setgroups): Enhance docstring, per doc/ref/posix.texi.

	* simpos.c (scm_system_star): Change scm_from_long to scm_from_int on

	to discouraged.h and rewriting in terms of scm_to_double.
	Replaced all uses with scm_to_double.
	(scm_to_double): Do not implement in terms of scm_num2dbl, use
	explicit code.
	(scm_from_double): Do not implement in terms of scm_make_real, use

	configure now produces.
	* gen-scmconfig.c: Use them to output SCM_T_INT8_MIN, etc

	* boolean.h, boolean.c (scm_is_true, scm_is_false, scm_from_bool,
	scm_to_bool): New.

2004-06-27  Dirk Herrmann  <dirk@dirk-herrmanns-seiten.de>

	* backtrace.c (display_expression, display_frame): Call
	scm_i_unmemoize_expr for unmemoizing a memoized object holding a
	single memoized expression.

	* debug.c (memoized_print): Don't try to unmemoize the memoized
	object, since we can't know whether it holds a single expression
	or a body.

	(scm_mem_to_proc): Removed check for lambda expression, since it
	was moot anyway.  Whoever uses these functions for debugging
	purposes should know what they do: Creating invalid memoized code
	will cause crashes, independent of whether this check is present
	or not.

	(scm_proc_to_mem): Take the closure's code as it is and don't
	append a SCM_IM_LAMBDA isym.  To allow easier debugging, the
	memoized code should not be modified.

	* debug.[ch] (scm_unmemoize, scm_i_unmemoize_expr): Removed
	scm_unmemoize from public use, but made scm_i_unmemoize_expr
	available as a guile internal function instead.  However,
	scm_i_unmemoize_expr will only work on memoized objects that hold
	a single memoized expression.  It won't work with bodies.

	* debug.c (scm_procedure_source), macros.c (macro_print), print.c
	(scm_iprin1): Call scm_i_unmemocopy_body for unmemoizing a body,
	i. e. a list of expressions.

	* eval.c (unmemoize_exprs): Drop internal body markers from the
	output during unmemoization.

	* eval.[ch] (scm_unmemocopy, scm_i_unmemocopy_expr,
	scm_i_unmemocopy_body): Removed scm_unmemocopy from public use,
	but made scm_i_unmemocopy_expr and scm_i_unmemocopy_body available
	as guile internal functions instead.  scm_i_unmemoize_expr will
	only work on a single memoized expression, while
	scm_i_unmemocopy_body will only work on bodies.

2004-06-21  Dirk Herrmann  <dirk@dirk-herrmanns-seiten.de>

	* eval.c (unmemoize_exprs): Handle semi-memoized code.

	(scm_cons_source, scm_primitive_eval): Prefer higher level
	predicate SCM_FALSEP over SCM_IMP.

2004-06-15  Rob Browning  <rlb@defaultvalue.org>

	* script.c (scm_shell_usage): minor phrasing change.

	* gc_os_dep.c: update ifdefery for macosx.
	(scm_get_stack_base): separate result initialization from
	declaration to slience warnings with macosx and hp-ux using gcc
	3.3.  Thanks to Andreas Vögele.

2004-06-13  Han-Wen Nienhuys   <hanwen@xs4all.nl>

	* eval.c (unmemoize_exprs): use SCM_CONSP for the loop condition.

2004-06-06  Dirk Herrmann  <dirk@dirk-herrmanns-seiten.de>

	* list.[ch] (scm_i_finite_list_copy): New internal function to
	copy lists that are known to be finite (though not necessarily
	proper).

	* debug.c (scm_procedure_source): Don't have scm_unmemocopy treat
	a closure's argument list like an expression of a body.

	* eval.c (unmemoize_expression, unmemoize_exprs, unmemoize_and,
	unmemoize_begin, unmemoize_case, unmemoize_cond, unmemoize_delay,
	unmemoize_do, unmemoize_if, unmemoize_lambda, unmemoize_let,
	unmemoize_letrec, unmemoize_letstar, unmemoize_or,
	unmemoize_set_x, unmemoize_apply, unmemoize_atcall_cc,
	unmemoize_at_call_with_values, unmemoize_future, sym_atslot_ref,
	unmemoize_atslot_ref, sym_atslot_set_x, unmemoize_atslot_set_x,
	unmemoize_builtin_macro): New static functions and symbols.

	(scm_unmemocopy): Rewritten in terms of the above.  scm_unmemocopy
	now has a slightly different meaning: The memoized form that is
	receives as its argument is now interpreted as a sequence of
	expressions from a body.

	(unmemocar, scm_unmemocar): Since the whole functionality of
	unmemocar and scm_unmemocar is not needed any more, scm_unmemocar
	has its old content back and is deprecated, while unmemocar has
	been removed.

	(SCM_BIT7): Removed.

	(CEVAL): For unmemoizing a single expression, call
	unmemoize_expression instead of scm_unmemocopy, which now expects
	a sequence of body expressions.  Eliminated unnecessary empty
	environment frame when executing let* forms.  Eliminated
	unmemoization step from evaluator.

2004-06-02  Marius Vollmer  <marius.vollmer@uni-dortmund.de>

	* eval.c (scm_macroexp, macroexp): Renamed scm_macroexp to
	macroexp and made static.  Added new version of scm_macroexp that
	emits a deprecation warning and then calls macroexp.
	(scm_m_undefine): Issue deprecation warning.

2004-05-30  Dirk Herrmann  <dirk@dirk-herrmanns-seiten.de>

	* eval.c (lookup_global_symbol, literal_p, try_macro_lookup):
	Modified to make set! work on symbols that represent syntactic
	keywords.

2004-05-26  Han-Wen Nienhuys   <hanwen@xs4all.nl>

	* gc.h (SCM_CELL_OBJECT_LOC): use SCM_GC_CELL_OBJECT to prevent
	compound expression as lvalue errors.

2004-05-24  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	* dynwind.c (winder_mark): Use SCM_PACK to correctly convert the
	WINDER_DATA to a SCM.

2004-05-24  Dirk Herrmann  <dirk@dirk-herrmanns-seiten.de>

	* goops.c (compute_getters_n_setters, create_standard_classes,
	scm_add_slot): Compute closures by calling scm_i_eval_x on a
	lambda expression rather than creating them with scm_closure.

2004-05-22  Dirk Herrmann  <dirk@dirk-herrmanns-seiten.de>

	* eval.c (s_macro_keyword, scm_m_set_x): Remove checking for
	misplaced syntactic keywords.  This will not work unless guile's
	defmacro feature is deprecated.

	(scm_m_case): Fixed a bug that caused the list of labels to grow
	with every case form.

2004-05-19  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* numbers.c (scm_round_number): For inum and big, just return x.  For
	real, use scm_round for 2^54-1 etc problems covered there.

	* numbers.c (trunc): Remove #define to scm_truncate when the C library
	doesn't provide trunc.  This was for when `truncate' was done as a
	scm_tc7_dsubr, no longer required.

	* threads.c (scm_threads_mark_stacks) [SCM_STACK_GROWS_UP]: Correction
	to stack marking call, two parameters and no cast on t->base.

2004-05-18  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	* hashtab.c (rehash_after_gc): Bug fix: properly link the
	processed hashtables back into the weak_hashtables list.  Thanks
	to Bill Schottstaedt!

2004-05-16  Dirk Herrmann  <dirk@dirk-herrmanns-seiten.de>

	* eval.c (unmemoize_quote): New static function.

	(scm_m_quote, scm_m_atslot_ref, SCM_CEVAL): Changed the byte code
	representation of 'quote' and '@slot-ref' to an improper list.
	This reduces execution time, the number of cells used to hold the
	memoized code, and thus also reduces garbage collection time.

	(scm_unmemocopy): Use unmemoize_quote for quote expressions.

	(SCM_CEVAL): Changed macro handling to also work with macros that
	return improper lists.  Added an assertion, that the code returned
	by a macro transformer will not lead to cycles in the memoized
	code.

2004-05-15  Dirk Herrmann  <dirk@dirk-herrmanns-seiten.de>

	No functional change, just rearrangements of functions within the
	file.

	* eval.c (scm_ilookup, scm_unbound_variable_key,
	error_unbound_variable, scm_lookupcar1, scm_lookupcar): Moved to
	the definitions used for execution, since that's where they will
	belong to later.

2004-05-15  Dirk Herrmann  <dirk@dirk-herrmanns-seiten.de>

	* numbers.h (SCM_SLOPPY_FRACTIONP): Removed.  It was not used
	throughout guile, has not been part of an official release yet,
	and the concept of sloppy predicates has never been a good idea.

	(SCM_FRACTION_NUMERATOR, SCM_FRACTION_DENOMINATOR,
	SCM_FRACTION_SET_NUMERATOR, SCM_FRACTION_SET_DENOMINATOR):
	Simplified.

2004-05-15  Dirk Herrmann  <dirk@dirk-herrmanns-seiten.de>

	* throw.c (SETJBJMPBUF, SCM_SETJBDFRAME): Add cast to scm_t_bits
	to make explicit what happens.

2004-05-15  Dirk Herrmann  <dirk@dirk-herrmanns-seiten.de>

	* dynl.c (SET_DYNL_HANDLE): Add cast to scm_t_bits to make
	explicit what happens.

	* guardians.c (TCONC_IN): Use SCM_SET_CELL_OBJECT_x rather than
	SCM_SET_CELL_WORD_x when writing scheme objets to cell elements.

2004-05-11  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	* scmsigs.c (scm_sigaction_for_thread): Validate that the handler
	is indeed a procedure when it isn't a number.

2004-05-10  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	Convert floating point numbers into strings with an arbitrary
	radix.  Thanks to Richard Todd!

	* numbers.c (FLOBUFLEN): Increase so that radix 2 strings will
	fit.
	(fx): Removed.
	(scm_dblprec, fx_per_radix, init_dblprec, init_fx_radix,
	number_chars): New, to support variable radices.
	(idbl2str): Use above instead of the old base-10 only tables.
	(iflo2str): Pass on new RADIX argument to idbl2str.
	(scm_number_to_string): Pass radix to iflo2str.
	(scm_print_real, scm_print_complex): Explicitly pass radix 10 to
	iflo2str.
	(scm_init_numbers): Call init_dblprec and init_fx_radix for all
	possible radices.

2004-05-10  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* numbers.c (scm_logbit_p): Correction to test above the end of an
	inum.  Reported by Jan Konecny.

2004-05-06  Marius Vollmer  <marius.vollmer@uni-dortmund.de>

	* gc.h (scm_t_cell): Fields are now of type SCM instead of
	scm_t_bits.  Updated all users.
	(SCM_GC_CARD_SIZE_MASK): Use SCM_GC_SIZEOF_CARD instead of
	duplicating the code.
	(SCM_CELL_OBJECT_LOC): New.
	(SCM_CARLOC, SCM_CDRLOC): Use it instead of SCM_CELL_WORD_LOC.
	(SCM_CELL_WORD_LOC): Moved to "deprecated.h".

	* smob.h (SCM_SMOB_DATA_2, SCM_SMOB_DATA_3, SCM_SMOB_FLAGS,
	SCM_SET_SMOB_DATA_2, SCM_SET_SMOB_DATA_3, SCM_SET_SMOB_FLAGS,
	SCM_SMOB_OBJECT, SCM_SMOB_OBJECT_2, SCM_SMOB_OBJECT_3,
	SCM_SET_SMOB_OBJECT, SCM_SET_SMOB_OBJECT_2, SCM_SET_SMOB_OBJECT_3,
	SCM_SMOB_OBJECT_LOC, SCM_SMOB_OBJECT_2_LOC,
	SCM_SMOB_OBJECT_3_LOC): New.
	* smob.c (scm_i_set_smob_flags): New function.

	* dynl.c, dynwind.c, eval.h, fluids.h, futures.h, hashtab.h,
	hooks.h, keywords.h, macros.h, macros.c, mallocs.c, mallocs.h,
	random.h, regex-posix.h, root.h, srcprop.h, srcprop.c, threads.h:
	Use SCM_SMOB_* instead of SCM_CELL_* as appropriate.  Use
	SCM_SMOB_FLAGS and SCM_SET_SMOB_FLAGS instead of accessing the
	zeroth word directly.  Use SCM_SMOB_PREDICATE as appropriate.

	* numbers.h (SCM_I_BIG_MPZ): Use SCM_CELL_OBJECT_LOC instead of
	taking the address of SCM_CELL_WORD_1, the latter being no longer
	an lvalue.

	* variable.h (SCM_VARIABLE_LOC): Use SCM_CELL_OBJECT_LOC instead
	of casting SCM_CELL_WORD_LOC.

2004-05-02  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* eval.c (scm_macroexp): Add prototype, since it's not in eval.h under
	--disable-deprecated.  Reported by Andreas Vögele.

	* filesys.c (_POSIX_C_SOURCE): Define to 199506L to get readdir_r (in
	particular on HP-UX).  Reported by Andreas Vögele.

	* list.c (varargs.h): Remove, leave just stdarg.h which is all the
	code has support for.  Fixes building with AIX cc, which is ansi but
	doesn't define __STDC__.  Reported by Keith Crane.
	(var_start): Remove macro, this variation no longer required.
	(scm_list_n): Use va_start directly.

2004-05-01  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* continuations.c (scm_dynthrow): Use >= instead of SCM_PTR_GE which
	is now gone.  Reported by Andreas Vögele.

2004-04-28  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* backtrace.c (display_frame_expr), numbers.c (XDIGIT2UINT,
	mem2uinteger, mem2decimal_from_point, mem2ureal): Cast char to int for
	ctype.h tests, to avoid warnings from gcc on HP-UX about char as array
	subscript.  Reported by Andreas Vögele.
	Also cast through unsigned char to avoid passing negatives to those
	macros if input contains 8-bit values.

	* num2integral.i.c (NUM2INTEGRAL): Under non-BIGMPZ_FITSP case,
	corrections to range check for signed numbers.  Remove
	scm_remember_upto_here_1(num) from these checks, since num is used
	subsequently anyway.

	* num2integral.i.c (NUM2INTEGRAL): Test BIGMPZ_FITSP with "!= 0" to
	avoid warning from gcc 3.4.  Reported by Hyperdivision.

	* numbers.c (scm_bit_extract): Use min instead of MIN.
	(MIN): Remove, this conflicts with similar macro defined by limits.h
	on HP-UX.  Reported by Andreas Vögele.

	* stime.c (_POSIX_C_SOURCE): Define to 199506L to get gmtime_r (in
	particular on HP-UX).  Reported by Andreas Vögele.

	* threads.c (scm_threads_mark_stacks): Correction sizet -> size_t.
	Reported by Andreas Vögele.

	* threads-plugin.h (SCM_MUTEX_MAXSIZE): Increase to 25*sizeof(long),
	for the benefit of hpux11 where pthread_mutex_t is 88 bytes.  Reported
	by Andreas Vögele.

2004-04-22  Dirk Herrmann  <dirk@dirk-herrmanns-seiten.de>

	* eval.c (s_macro_keyword): New static identifier.

	(scm_m_define): Change order to first create binding and
	evaluating the expression afterwards.

	(scm_m_set_x): Memoize complete set! expression.  Only leave
	symbols if no binding exists at memoization time.  Throw error if
	assigning to a syntactic keyword.

	(lazy_memoize_variable): New function.

	(CEVAL): When execution set!, perform lazy memoization if
	unmemoized symbol is detected.

	* modules.c (module_variable): Return variables with unbound
	value.

	* tags.h: Fix comment.

2004-04-25  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* chars.c (scm_char_upcase, scm_char_downcase, scm_c_upcase,
	scm_c_downcase): Use ctype.h toupper and tolower.  This will be useful
	in 8-bit locales, and ensures consistency with char-upper-case? and
	char-lower-case? which already use ctype.h.
	(scm_c_upcase_table, scm_c_downcase_table, scm_lowers, scm_uppers):
	Remove.
	* chars.c, chars.h, init.c (scm_tables_prehistory): Remove.

	* socket.c (VALIDATE_INET6): Correction to bignum_in_ipv6_range_p
	call.  Reported by Hyperdivision.

	* threads.c (scm_yield): Correction, actually call scm_thread_yield.
	Reported by Hyperdivision.

	* unif.c (s_scm_make_uve): Remove unused local variable.  Reported by
	Hyperdivision.

2004-04-22  Dirk Herrmann  <dirk@dirk-herrmanns-seiten.de>

	Hide the implementation of ilocs and isyms in eval.c.

	* deprecated.h (SCM_IFRINC, SCM_ICDR, SCM_IFRAME, SCM_IDIST,
	SCM_ICDRP), eval.c (SCM_IFRINC, SCM_ICDR, SCM_IFRAME, SCM_IDIST,
	SCM_ICDRP), eval.h (SCM_ICDR, SCM_IFRINC, SCM_IFRAME, SCM_IDIST,
	SCM_ICDRP): Deprecated and added to deprecated.h.  Moved from
	eval.h to eval.c.

	* deprecated.c (scm_isymnames), deprecated.h (scm_isymnames,
	SCM_ISYMNUM, SCM_ISYMCHARS), eval.c (SCM_ISYMNUM, isymnames,
	scm_unmemocopy, CEVAL), print.c (scm_isymnames), tags.h
	(SCM_ISYMNUM, scm_isymnames, SCM_ISYMCHARS): Deprecated
	scm_isymnames, SCM_ISYMNUM and SCM_ISYMCHARS and added to
	deprecated.[hc].  Moved scm_isymnames from print.c to eval.c and
	renamed to isymnames.  Moved SCM_ISYMNUM from tags.h to eval.c and
	renamed to ISYMNUM.

	* eval.c (scm_i_print_iloc, scm_i_print_isym), eval.h
	(scm_i_print_iloc, scm_i_print_isym), print.c (scm_iprin1):
	Extracted printing of ilocs and isyms to guile internal functions
	scm_i_print_iloc, scm_i_print_isym of eval.c.

2004-04-22  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* numbers.c (scm_bit_extract): Use SCM_SRS for signed right shift.

	* numbers.c (scm_round): Test for x already an integer, to avoid bad
	rounding in x+0.5 when x is a big value already an integer.  In
	certain hardware rounding cases x+0.5 can give an adjacent integer,
	leading to that as the result, when we really just wanted x itself.

2004-04-19  Dirk Herrmann  <dirk@dirk-herrmanns-seiten.de>

	* eval.c (scm_unmemocopy): Fixed unmemoization of let*.

	(deval_args, CEVAL): Minor improvements: Reduced variable scopes,
	added const qualifiers, cast intentionally unused expressions to
	void for emphasis, improved comment.

2004-04-18  Dirk Herrmann  <dirk@dirk-herrmanns-seiten.de>

	* tags.h (scm_tags, scm_tc8_tags, scm_tc9_flag, scm_tc8_flag,
	scm_tc8_isym): Renamed scm_tags to scm_tc8_tags.  Renamed
	scm_tc9_flag to scm_tc8_flag.  Introduced new identifier
	scm_tc8_isym.  Defined tc8-tags relative to scm_tc3_imm24.
	Defined the tc8-tag for flags to be 0x04, which will mean that
	SCM_BOOL_F will also have the value 0x04 instead of 0x013c.  Due
	to the reduced number of bits and the simpler bit pattern for
	SCM_BOOL_F, certain machines may be able to use more efficient
	processor instructions to deal with SCM_BOOL_F.

	(SCM_ITAG9, SCM_MAKE_ITAG9, SCM_ITAG9_DATA): Removed.  These have
	never been defined in a released version, thus no need to
	deprecate them.

	(SCM_IFLAGP, SCM_MAKIFLAG, SCM_IFLAGNUM): Flags now use tc8
	instead of tc9 tags.

	(SCM_ISYMP, SCM_MAKISYM, SCM_ISYMNUM): Isyms now use tc8 instead
	of tc9 tags.

	(SCM_MAKSPCSYM): Removed.  It is almost impossible that user code
	could have used this definition.

	(SCM_IM_AND, SCM_IM_BEGIN, SCM_IM_CASE, SCM_IM_COND, SCM_IM_DO,
	SCM_IM_IF, SCM_IM_LAMBDA, SCM_IM_LET, SCM_IM_LETSTAR,
	SCM_IM_LETREC, SCM_IM_OR, SCM_IM_QUOTE, SCM_IM_SET_X): Now encoded
	as isyms, as special isyms don't exist any more.

2004-04-18  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* filesys.c (scm_readdir): Use readdir_r when available, for thread
	safety.

	* numbers.c (scm_max, scm_min): For big/real, use SCM_SWAP rather than
	explicit swapping code.

2004-04-15  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* cpp_sig_symbols.in: Add SIGSYS.

	* list.c (scm_append_x): Use iterative style, to avoid non-tail
	recursion.

	* numbers.c (scm_max, scm_min): For inum/frac, frac/inum, big/frac,
	frac/big and frac/frac, use scm_less_p for exact comparison.

	* numbers.c (scm_gcd): For inum/big, use mpz_gcd_ui by sharing code
	with big/inum.

	* numbers.c (xisinf): Add a comment about solaris 7 lacking isinf.

2004-04-06  Han-Wen Nienhuys   <hanwen@xs4all.nl>

	* inline.h (scm_cell): use SCM_GC_CELL_WORD for checking tag.

	* chars.h (scm_init_chars): change scm_{upcase,downcase} to
	scm_c_{up,down}case.
	(SCM_MAKE_CHAR): add (unsigned char) cast. This prevents havoc
	when hi-bit ASCII is subjected to SCM_MAKE_CHAR().

2004-04-06  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* numbers.c (scm_ash): Remove stray "}" in docstring.

	* numbers.c (scm_make_ratio): For inum/bignum integer detection, use
	x==SCM_MOST_NEGATIVE_FIXNUM explicitly, for clarity and to avoid
	calling mpz_cmp_ui in most cases.

	* numbers.c (scm_quotient, scm_remainder): In inum/big, use mpz_cmp_ui
	for big == abs(most-negative-fixnum) special case.
	(abs_most_negative_fixnum): Remove, no longer used.

	* scmsigs.c (scm_sigaction_for_thread): Correction to signum range
	test, avoids SCM_VECTOR_REF outside bounds of signal_handlers on
	calling (sigaction NSIG).

	* simpos.c (scm_system_star): Fix execargv memory leak, merge parent
	and fork error cases to do this.

2004-04-03  Dirk Herrmann  <dirk@dirk-herrmanns-seiten.de>

	* eval.c (CEVAL): Don't distinguish between short and long
	instructions when dispatching - just always dispatch on the
	instruction code, which is common for short and long instructions.
	Further, removed unnecessary goto statements and added comment.

2004-04-03  Dirk Herrmann  <dirk@dirk-herrmanns-seiten.de>

	* eval.c (scm_unmemocopy): Don't distinguish between short and
	long instructions when dispatching - just always dispatch on the
	instruction code, which is common for short and long instructions.
	Further, removed unnecessary goto statements, fixed indentation
	and replaced SCM_IMP predicates by SCM_NULLP.

2004-04-03  Dirk Herrmann  <dirk@dirk-herrmanns-seiten.de>

	* eval.c (scm_lookupcar1, CEVAL): Use SCM_ILOCP instead of
	comparison with SCM_ILOC00.  In CEVAL, eliminate goto-label
	'checkmacro'.

2004-03-31  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* simpos.c: Include <signal.h> for SIG_IGN and friends.

2004-03-29  Dirk Herrmann  <dirk@dirk-herrmanns-seiten.de>

	Introduce scm_debug_mode_p as a replacement for scm_debug_mode and
	SCM_DEBUGGINGP:

	* debug.h (scm_debug_mode_p, scm_debug_mode, SCM_DEBUGGINGP),
	eval.c (scm_debug_mode_p): Deprecated scm_debug_mode and
	SCM_DEBUGGINGP.  Provided scm_debug_mode_p instead, to have one
	single interface that also matches the naming conventions.
	Probably scm_debug_mode_p should be part of the private interface
	anyway.

	* debug.h (scm_debug_mode_p), backtrace.c (display_error_body),
	eval.c (SCM_APPLY, scm_trampoline_0, scm_trampoline_1,
	scm_trampoline_2): Change uses of scm_debug_mode or SCM_DEBUGGINGP
	to scm_debug_mode_p.


	Deprecate direct access to scm_ceval, scm_deval and scm_ceval_ptr:

	* eval.h (scm_ceval, scm_deval, scm_ceval_ptr), debug.h
	(scm_ceval_ptr): Deprecated.  Moved declaration of scm_ceval_ptr
	from debug.h to eval.h.

	* debug.h (SCM_RESET_DEBUG_MODE): Don't access scm_ceval_ptr any
	more, just leave it with setting scm_debug_mode_p, which is
	equivalent for practical purposes.

	* deprecated.h (SCM_XEVAL, SCM_XEVALCAR): Call scm_i_eval_x
	instead of *scm_ceval_ptr.  Leave all evaluating to scm_i_eval_x.

	* gdbint.c (gdb_eval): Call scm_i_eval_x instead of scm_ceval.

	* eval.c (ceval, deval, scm_ceval, scm_deval): Made scm_ceval
	static and renamed it to ceval throughout.  Provide a new exported
	but deprecated function scm_ceval as a wrapper for backwards
	compatibility.  The same is done for the deval/scm_deval pair of
	functions.

	* eval.c (CEVAL, SCM_CEVAL): Renamed SCM_CEVAL to CEVAL
	throughout.  Defined CEVAL to ceval or deval, based on compilation
	phase.

	* eval.c (SCM_XEVAL, SCM_XEVALCAR): Dispatch on scm_debug_mode_p
	to ceval and deval instead of calling *scm_ceval_ptr.

	* eval.c (dispatching_eval): New deprecated static function.

	* eval.c (scm_ceval_ptr): Initialized to dispatching_eval in order
	to emulate its old behaviour as closely as possible.


	Change the evaluator such that only expressions for which pair? is
	true are passed to CEVAL, and such that all other expressions are
	evaluated outside of CEVAL:

	* eval.c (EVAL): New, provided in analogy to EVALCAR.  Evaluate an
	expression that is assumed to be memoized already.  All but
	expressions of the form '(<form> <form> ...)' are evaluated inline
	without calling an evaluator.

	* eval.c (SCM_XEVAL, SCM_XEVALCAR, EVALCAR): Evaluate all but
	expressions of the form '(<form> <form> ...)' inline without
	calling an evaluator.

	* eval.c (scm_i_eval_x, scm_i_eval, scm_ceval, scm_deval): Handle
	the special case of unmemoized symbols passed on the top level.

	* eval.c (CEVAL): Change calls to CEVAL to EVAL, except where it
	is known that the expression passed to CEVAL is of the form
	'(<form> <form> ...)'.  Remove handling of the tc7-objects, since
	now it is known that the input expression of CEVAL is a pair.

2004-03-29  Dirk Herrmann  <dirk@dirk-herrmanns-seiten.de>

	* eval.c (is_self_quoting_p): New static function.

	(scm_m_quote): Use is_self_quoting_p.

	(copy_tree): Corrected typo in comment.

2004-03-28  Han-Wen Nienhuys   <hanwen@xs4all.nl>

	* eval.c (s_scm_copy_tree): idem.

	* list.c (s_scm_filter): remove "pointer" from doc string.

	* gc.h (SCM_GC_CELL_TYPE): SCM_GC_CELL_TYPE uses SCM_GC_CELL_OBJECT.

	* goops.h (SCM_NUMBER_OF_SLOTS): don't SCM_UNPACK the result.

	* backtrace.c ("display_backtrace_body"): SCM_PACK before SCM_EQ_P
	(display_frame): idem.
	(display_backtrace_file_and_line): idem.

	* tags.h (SCM_UNPACK): stricter typechecking on SCM_UNPACK
	arguments.

2004-03-26  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* filesys.c (scm_getcwd, scm_readlink): Avoid memory leak on errors.

	* numbers.c (scm_modulo): For inum/big and big/big, remove test of
	big==0 since that never occurs.

	* numbers.c, numbers.h (scm_modulo_expt): Renamed from
	scm_modular_expt, matching scheme level name `modulo-expt'.

	* numbers.c (scm_modular_expt): Return a negative remainder for a
	negative divisor, the same as `modulo' does.

2004-03-26  Eric Hanchrow <offby1@blarg.net>

	* numbers.c, numbers.h (scm_modular_expt): New function.

2004-03-25  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	return inexact as required by r5rs.

2004-03-24  Dirk Herrmann  <dirk@dirk-herrmanns-seiten.de>

	* eval.c: Separated some definitions relevant for execution from
	the memoization part of the file.

	(copy_tree): New static function

	(scm_copy_tree): Rewritten to fix two kinds or bugs: First, cyclic
	structures are detected now and will lead to an exception instead
	of forcing guile to run in an endless loop, using up all the
	system's memory.  Second, arrays in the cdr of an improper list
	are now copied.  See the new test cases in eval.test.

2004-03-24  Dirk Herrmann  <dirk@dirk-herrmanns-seiten.de>

	* posix.c (scm_gethostname): Make sure len is initialised before
	it is used.  Restructured to (hopefully) represent possible
	configurations more clearly in the code.  Added unwind handler.

2004-03-23  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* posix.c (scm_gethostname): Use sysconf(_SC_HOST_NAME_MAX) and/or
	MAXHOSTNAMELEN when available.

2004-03-21  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	* read.c (skip_scsh_block_comment): Also recognize '\r' as a line
	terminator.  Rewritten the logic as a state machine, I must have
	been doing too much VHDL lately...

	* eval.c (scm_ceval, scm_deval): Explicitely evaluate ports to
	themselves.  Thanks to Han-Wen Nienhuys!

	* list.c: Changed docstrings so that they no longer talk about
	returning 'pointers' to something.

2004-03-20  Han-Wen Nienhuys   <hanwen@xs4all.nl>

	* gc.c: remove set_debug_cell_accesses! when
	SCM_DEBUG_CELL_ACCESSES is not defined. Scheme source code should
	use (if (defined? 'set-debug-cell-accesses!) .. ) to switch on
	debugging conditionally.

2004-03-21  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* stime.c (scm_gmtime): Use gmtime_r when available, for thread safety.

2004-03-20  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	free cells.

2004-03-14  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* stime.c: Define _GNU_SOURCE for strptime prototype from glibc.
	(strptime): Use	HAVE_DECL_STRPTIME for when to give own prototype.

2004-03-07  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* stime.c (scm_gmtime): Return bd_time->tm_zone when available, rather
	than "GMT" always.
	(filltime): Make zname parameter "const".

2004-03-03  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@chunk.mit.edu>

	* threads.c, threads.h (scm_c_scm2thread): New function.

2004-02-29  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* numbers.c (guile_ieee_init): Use C99 INFINITY and NAN when
	available.  Test HAVE_DINFINITY and HAVE_DQNAN for those globals, in
	particular don't assume "defined (__alpha__) && ! defined (linux)"
	means OSF.  Remove "SCO" code, which was not really SCO specific and
	which John W. Eaton advises should be long past being needed.

	* posix.c (scm_execl, scm_execlp, scm_execle): Avoid memory leak under
	error throw.

2004-02-24  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* posix.c (scm_cuserid): Use a private result buffer, for thread safe.

2004-02-22  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* numbers.c (scm_max, scm_min): For one arg, dispatch to generic for
	complex, same as for two args.  (Handle only inum, big, real, frac).

2004-02-21  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* posix.c (scm_crypt): Use new HAVE_CRYPT.
	(<crypt.h>): Remove HAVE_LIBCRYPT condition.
	Reported by Andreas Voegele.

2004-02-20  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	* list.c (scm_list_n): Add #if SCM_DEBUG_CELL_ACCESSES_P around
	validation.

	* read.c (scm_lreadparen): Removed.
	(scm_lreadparen1): Renamed scm_i_lreadparen.

2004-02-20  Han-Wen Nienhuys   <hanwen@xs4all.nl>

	* list.c (scm_list_n): validate non-immediate arguments;
	this will catch forgotten a SCM_UNDEFINED.

	* gc.h (scm_gc_cells_collected): Removed duplicated declaration.
	Thanks to Bill Schottstaedt!

	* socket.h (scm_gethost): Removed prototype it is already in
	"net_db.h".  Thanks to Bill Schottstaedt!

2004-02-18  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* num2integral.i.c (INTEGRAL2BIG): WORDS_BIGENDIAN not right for word
	order parameter to mpz_import, in fact with just one word there's no
	order to worry about at all.

	* numbers.c (scm_num_eq_p): For real==frac, complex==frac, frac==real
	and frac==complex, make an exact comparison rather than converting
	with fraction2double.

	* posix.c, putenv.c, stime.c (environ): Use _NSGetEnviron in Darwin
	shared library, since environ is not directly available there.

	* script.c (scm_shell_usage): Print to stdout for --help, per GNU
	standard.

	* stime.c (scm_localtime, scm_gmtime, scm_mktime): Provide a default
	errno EINVAL in case localtime and gmtime don't set it.
	(scm_mktime, scm_strptime): Forcibly use errno EINVAL for our
	SCM_SYSERROR, since mktime and strptime generally don't set errno.

2004-02-16  Kevin Ryde  <kevin@swox.se>

	* gc-malloc.c (scm_done_malloc, scm_done_free): Allow negative sizes,
	which were permitted in the past for these.

	* num2float.i.c (NUM2FLOAT): Expand isfinite to !xisinf, as per
	previous change to numbers.c.

	* script.c (scm_shell_usage): Print bug-guile email address, as per
	GNU standard.  Reported by Han-Wen Nienhuys.

2004-02-13  Mikael Djurfeldt  <djurfeldt@nada.kth.se>

	code in order to avoid compiler used uninitialized warnings.

	* hashtab.c, hashtab.h (scm_hash_map_to_list): Renamed from
	scm_hash_map.
	(scm_hash_fold): Use scm_call_3 directly in the call to
	scm_internal_hash_fold instead of going via fold_proc (which is
	now removed).
	(scm_hash_for_each): Use a trampoline +
	scm_internal_hash_for_each_handle.
	(scm_internal_hash_for_each_handle, scm_hash_for_each_handle): New
	functions.

	* ports.c (scm_port_line): In docstring, note first line is 0.
	(scm_set_port_line_x): In docstring, note first line is 0.
	(scm_port_column): In docstring, there's no default to current input
	port, and remove shared port-line @defun.
	(scm_set_port_column_x): In docstring, there's no default to current
	input port, note first column is 0, remove shared set-port-line!
	@defun.

	* ramap.c (scm_array_fill_x): For fvect and dvect, use scm_num2dbl to
	convert args the same way that array-set! does.

	* unif.c (scm_make_uve, scm_array_p): Allow fraction 1/3 as prototype
	for dvect.
	(scm_array_p): Add missing "break"s in switch, fix llvect test look
	for "l" not "s", fix dvect to be false for singp(prot) since such a
	value is for fvect.
	(scm_array_prototype): Return 1/3 for dvect, rather than 0.33..33.
	(exactly_one_third): New variable.
	(scm_init_unif): Initialize it.

2004-02-10  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	* read.c (scm_read_opts): Change `escaped-parens' to
	`elisp-strings'.

2004-02-08  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	* read.c (scm_read_opts): New opts `elisp-vectors' and
	`escaped-parens'.
	(s_vector): New.
	(scm_lreadr): Use scm_lreadparen1 instead of scm_lreadparen.  Make
	handling of elisp vector syntax dependent on SCM_ENABLE_ELISP and
	`elisp-vectors' option instead of SCM_ELISP_READ_EXTENSIONS.
	Allow "\(" and "\)" in strings when SCM_ENABLE_ELISP defined and
	`escaped-parens' option set.
	(scm_read_token): If elisp vector syntax active, disallow [ and ]
	in tokens.
	(scm_lreadparen): Rewrite as interface to scm_lreadparen1.
	(scm_lreadparen1): New.

	* read.h: Remove conditionally compiled last arg to
	scm_lreadparen.
	(SCM_ELISP_VECTORS_P, SCM_ESCAPED_PARENS_P): New.

2004-01-23  Han-Wen Nienhuys   <hanwen@xs4all.nl>

	* eval.c (m_expand_body): remove stray variable new_body.

2004-01-22  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	* eval.c (m_expand_body): Rewrite the expression in place (by
	overwriting FORMS) also when a letrec is constructed, not only
	when no definitions are found.  Do not return rewritten expression
	to emphasize the in-place rewriting.  Changed all users.

2004-01-19  Han-Wen Nienhuys   <hanwen@xs4all.nl>

	* gc.c: add protected_object_count, a number that is dumped from
	gc_stats()

2004-01-11  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	* dynwind.h, dynwind.c (scm_frame_unwind,
	scm_frame_unwind_handler): Renamed and changed all uses.
	(scm_frame_rewind, scm_frame_rewind_handler): Likewise.

2004-01-11  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* unif.c (scm_bit_count, scm_bit_position, s_scm_bit_set_star_x,
	s_scm_bit_count_star, s_scm_bit_invert_x): Clarify docstrings, as per
	changes made to scheme-compound.texi.

2004-01-10  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

 	* print.c (scm_print_symbol_name): Handle #{`foo}#, #{,foo}#,
	#{.}#, and all numeric strings specially.  Thanks to Paul Jarc!

	* guile-snarf.in: Use mkdir to create a unique temporary directory
	that we can safely use.  Thanks to Stefan Nordhausen!

2004-01-07  Marius Vollmer  <marius.vollmer@uni-dortmund.de>

	* dynwind.h, dynwind.c (scm_i_dowinds): Removed 'explicit'
	argument since it is always zero now.  Changed all callers.
	Removed code for handling fluids.

	* fluids.c (scm_c_with_fluids): Use frames instead of adding to
	the wind chain explicitely.  Use scm_c_with_fluid for the common
	case of only one fluid.
	(scm_with_fluid): New.
	(scm_c_with_fluid): Use frames instead of scm_c_with_fluids.

	* fluids.h, fluids.c (scm_frame_fluid): New.
	(scm_with_fluid): New.
	(scm_i_swap_fluids, scm_i_swap_fluids_reverse): Removed.

	* dynwind.c (scm_frame_end): Do not use scm_i_dowinds.  Instead,
	do the unwinding directly.  It is simple enough.

	* dynwind.h, dynwind.c: Did the following renamings:
	scm_begin_frame -> scm_frame_begin,
	scm_end_frame -> scm_frame_end,
	scm_on_unwind -> scm_frame_unwind,
	scm_on_rewind -> scm_frame_rewind,
	scm_on_unwind_with_scm -> scm_frame_unwind_with_scm,
	scm_on_rewind_with_scm -> scm_frame_rewind_with_scm.
	Changed all uses.

	* aync.h, async.c: Did the follwing renamings:
	scm_with_blocked_asyncs -> scm_frame_block_asyncs,
	scm_with_unblocked_asyncs -> scm_frame_unblock_asyncs.
	Changed all uses.

	* ports.h, ports.c: Did the follwing renamings:
	scm_with_current_input_port -> scm_frame_current_input_port,
	scm_with_current_output_port -> scm_frame_current_output_port,
	scm_with_current_error_port -> scm_frame_current_error_port.
	Changed all uses.

2004-01-07  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* numbers.c (s_bignum): Remove, not used since gmp bignums.
	Reported by Richard Todd.

	* threads-plugin.h (SCM_MUTEX_MAXSIZE): Increase to 12*sizeof(long),
	for the benefit of powerpc-apple-darwin5.5.  Reported by Richard Todd.

	* unif.c (scm_aind): Test SCM_CONSP rather than !SCM_NULLP while
	traversing the args list, fixes segv if an improper list is given.
	Reported by Rouben Rostamian.

2004-01-06  Marius Vollmer  <marius.vollmer@uni-dortmund.de>

	* ports.c (swap_ports, scm_with_current_foo_port): Do not allocate
	swap_data on stack, use a 'malloc obj'.

	* fluids.h, fluids.c (scm_make_initial_fluids, scm_copy_fluids,
	scm_swap_fluids, scm_swap_fluids_reverse): Renamed to
	scm_i_... since they are internal.  Changed all uses.

	* dynwind.c (frame_print): Removed, use the default printer.
	(WINDER_F_MARK, WINDER_MARK_P, winder_mark): New.
	(scm_on_unwind_with_scm, scm_on_rewind_with_scm): New. Use above
	to protect SCM values.

	* dynwind.h (SCM_F_WIND_EXPLICITELY,
	SCM_F_WIND_EXPLICITLY): It's "explicitly" not "explicitely", damn.
	Changed all uses.
	(scm_on_unwind_with_scm, scm_on_rewind_with_scm): New.

2004-01-05  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	* ports.h, ports.c (scm_with_current_input_port,
	scm_with_current_output_port, scm_with_current_error_port): New.

	* async.h, async.c (scm_with_blocked_asyncs,
	scm_with_unblocked_asyncs): New.

2004-01-03  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	* dynwind.h, scm_dynwind.c (scm_t_frame_flags, scm_t_wind_flags,
	scm_begin_frame, scm_end_frame, scm_on_unwind, scm_on_rewind):
	New.
	(scm_dowinds, scm_i_dowinds): scm_dowinds has been renamed to
	scm_i_dowinds and extended to handle frames and to invoke a 'turn'
	function when the outermost wind point has been reached.  The
	latter is used to copy a continuation stack at the right time.
	scm_dowinds remains available.
	(SCM_GUARDSP, SCM_BEFORE_GUARD, SCM_AFTER_GUARD, SCM_GUARD_DATA,
	tc16_guard, guards_print): Removed.
	(scm_internal_dynamic_wind): Reimplemented using frames.

	* continuations.c (copy_stack): New, do only the stack copying
	part of copy_stack_and_call.
	(copy_stack_and_call): Copy the stack after unwinding and before
	rewinding.
	(scm_dynthrow): Do not call scm_dowinds, this is now done by
	copy_stack_and_call.

2004-01-04  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* numbers.c (scm_less_p): Don't convert frac to float for compares,
	can give bad results due to rounding.

	* stime.c (scm_current_time, scm_gettimeofday): Add a comment about
	setzone/restorezone protection for DOS.

2003-12-26  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	* gen-scmconfig.h.in, gen-scmconfig.c: Arrange for scm_t_intmax
	and scm_t_uintmax to be defined in scmconfig.h

2003-12-03  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* numbers.c (scm_less_p): Remove spurious xisnan from frac+big case.

	* numbers.c (scm_make_ratio): Check for numerator equal to
	SCM_MOST_NEGATIVE_FIXNUM and bignum denominator the negative of that,
	giving integer -1.

	* numbers.c (scm_real_part): Return fraction unchanged rather than
	converting to flonum.

2003-11-30  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* modules.c (module_variable): Fixed (and thus simplified) the
	definition of SCM_BOUND_THING_P to reflect the fact that since
	after the 1.4 series of guile, obarrays only hold variable
	objects.

2003-11-30  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	* numbers.c (scm_logand): It's "#b...", not "#\b...".

	From Paul Jarc:

	* read.c (scm_lreadr): Signal an error for invalid escape
	sequences in strings.  Code cleanups too.

	* print.c (scm_iprin1): use \xNN hexadecimal sequences when
	writing control characters in strings.

2003-11-21  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	* ports.c (scm_drain_input): Bug fix: only access the port after
	checking that it indeed is one.

2003-11-22  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* eval.c (s_bad_define): New static identifier.

	(m_body): Fixed comment.

	(scm_m_define): Don't generate memoized code for definitions that
	are not on the top level.  As a consequence, no memoized code at
	all is generated for definitions any more: Top level definitions
	are executed immediately during memoization and internal
	definitions are handled separately in m_expand_body.

	(scm_unmemocopy, unmemocopy): Removed code for unmemoizing
	definitions.  Consequently, there is no unmemoizing code any more
	that might modify the environment.  Thus, the old scm_unmemocopy
	is removed and the old unmemocopy is renamed to scm_unmemocopy.

	(SCM_CEVAL): The SCM_IM_DEFINE keyword can no longer occur in
	memoized code.  Call EVALCAR for continuations.  Prefer !SCM_NULLP
	over SCM_NIMP in places, where the argument is known to be part of
	a proper list.

2003-11-21  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* numbers.c (scm_abs): Allocate a new real only for negatives, as done
	for bignums.

	* numbers.c (scm_bit_extract): Use mpz functions, rearrange inum case
	to share some shifting.

	* numbers.c (scm_integer_expt): Don't mpz_init after scm_i_clonebig or
	scm_i_mkbig, since they do so already.  Don't mpz_clear a bignum SCM,
	since gc does this.

2003-11-19  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	* numbers.c (scm_make_ratio): Rewritten to have a simpler
	structure.  Previously, not all cases with a negative denominator
	were covered.

	* numbers.c (mem2decimal_from_point): use scm_divide instead of
	scm_divide2real when forming the fractional part.  This allows
	"#e1.2" to yield 6/5.

	* numbers.c (scm_i_fraction_equalp): Do not treat the return value
	of scm_equal_p as a C boolean, use SCM_FALSEP.  Previously, all
	fractions were equal to each other regardless of value.  Ooops.

	* numbers.c (scm_rationalize): Return an inexact result when given
	inexact arguments.

	* numbers.c (scm_exact_p, scm_inexact_p): Throw error for
	non-numbers.

2003-11-18  Marius Vollmer  <marius.vollmer@uni-dortmund.de>

	New exact functions that replace the inexact 'dsubr'
	implementations.
	(scm_numerator, scm_denominator): New.

	* numbers.h (SCM_NUMP): Recognize fractions.
	(SCM_FRACTIONP, SCM_SLOPPY_FRACTIONP, SCM_FRACTION_NUMERATOR,

	SCM_FRACTION_SET_DENOMINATOR, SCM_FRACTION_REDUCED_BIT,
	SCM_FRACTION_REDUCED_SET, SCM_FRACTION_REDUCED_CLEAR,
	SCM_FRACTION_REDUCED): New.
	(scm_floor, scm_ceiling, scm_truncate_number, scm_round_number):
	New prototypes.
	(scm_make_ratio, scm_rationalize, scm_numerator, scm_denominator,
	scm_rational_p): New prototypes.
	(scm_i_dbl2num, scm_i_fraction2double, scm_i_fraction_equalp,

	* deprecated.h: move long_long and ulong_long definitions to
	gen-scmconfig.c so that we don't need to add SCM_SIZEOF___INT64

	* eval.c (scm_m_case): Allow empty lists of case labels.

	definition.

2003-10-07  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

 	* goops.c, objects.h, smob.c, smob.h: Make type names char
        const * instead of char *.  Thanks to Paul Jarc!

2003-10-02  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* strports.c (scm_call_with_output_string): scm_get_output_string
	rather than scm_strport_to_string, so as to guard against the port

2003-09-18  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* numbers.h (SCM_INEXACTP): Removed uses of SCM_TYP16S.

	numbers.  Bignums, reals and complex numbers are turned from smobs
	into subtypes of scm_tc7_number.

	* tags.h (scm_tc7_number): New.

	* eq.c (scm_equal_p), eval.c (SCM_CEVAL), evalext.c
	(scm_self_evaluating_p), gc-card.c (scm_i_sweep_card), gc-mark.c
	(scm_gc_mark_dependencies), goops.c (create_smob_classes), hash.c
	(scm_hasher), numbers.c, numbers.h (SCM_NUMP), objects.c
	(scm_class_of), print.c (scm_iprin1), smob.c
	(scm_smob_prehistory): Don't handle bignums, reals and complex
	numbers as subtypes of scm_tc7_smob any more.

	* numbers.h, tags.h (scm_tc16_big, scm_tc16_real,
	scm_tc16_complex): Moved definitions from tags.h to numbers.h.

2003-09-18  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* numbers.c (scm_make_complex), gc-card.c (scm_i_sweep_card): Use
	sizeof (scm_t_complex) to determine the memory size of the
	malloc'd area for complex numbers.

2003-09-17  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* numbers.c (scm_bigequal): Fixed.

2003-09-16  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	* stime.c (scm_current_time): 'time' does not set errno so don't
	use SCM_SYSERROR for reporting errors.

2003-09-16  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	This set of patches eliminates the dependency between the
	implementation of evaluator specific memoization codes and special
	constants like #f, '() etc. ('flags'), which are not evaluator
	specific.  The goal is to remove definitions of evaluator
	memoization codes completely from the public interface.  This will
	make it possible to experiment more freely with optimizations of
	guile's internal representation of memoized code.

	* objects.c (scm_class_of): Eliminate dependency on SCM_ISYMNUM.

	* print.c (iflagnames): New array, holding the printed names of
	guile's special constants ('flags').

	(scm_isymnames): Now holds only the printed names of the
	memoization codes.

	(scm_iprin1): Separate the handling of memoization codes and
	guile's special constants.

	* tags.h (scm_tc9_flag, SCM_ITAG9, SCM_MAKE_ITAG9, SCM_ITAG9_DATA,
	SCM_IFLAGNUM): new

	(scm_tc8_char, scm_tc8_iloc, SCM_BOOL_F, SCM_BOOL_T,
	SCM_UNDEFINED, SCM_EOF_VAL, SCM_EOL, SCM_UNSPECIFIED, SCM_UNBOUND,
	SCM_ELISP_NIL, SCM_IM_DISPATCH, SCM_IM_SLOT_REF,
	SCM_IM_SLOT_SET_X, SCM_IM_DELAY, SCM_IM_FUTURE,
	SCM_IM_CALL_WITH_VALUES, SCM_IM_NIL_COND, SCM_IM_BIND): Changed
	values.

	(SCM_IFLAGP): SCM_IFLAGP now only tests for flags.

	(SCM_IFLAGP, SCM_MAKIFLAG, SCM_IFLAGNUM): Generalized to use the
	tc9 macros and scm_tc9_flag.

2003-09-15  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	* posix.c (scm_setgroups): Check that the gid list is not too
	long.  Thanks to Paul Jarc!

2003-09-14  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* tags.h: Reduced the number of short instructions from 14 to 13.
	The typecode of the former 14th short instruction is now used to
	represent long instructions.  Changed some comments to reflect
	this fact.

	(SCM_MAKISYM): ISYMs get a new tc7 code, namely the one that was
	previously used by SCM_IM_DEFINE.

	(SCM_IM_DEFINE): Turned into a long instruction.

	* eval.c (unmemocopy, SCM_CEVAL): Treat SCM_IM_DEFINE as a long
	instruction.

	* eval.c (SCM_CEVAL): Since characters and iflags have now a tc7
	code that is separate from all instructions, one level of dispatch
	for long instructions can be eliminated.

	* print.c (scm_isymnames): Removed some commented code.

2003-09-12  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	* __scm.h (SCM_FENCE): Use __memory_barrier with the Intel
	compiler on IA64.

	* hashtab.h (scm_tc16_hashtable): Added "extern" declaration.

	* modules.c (scm_module_reverse_lookup): Check that the obarray
	really is a hashtable and do nothing if not.

	* inline.h: Use "extern inline" only with GCC.  Use "static
	inline" else.

2003-09-06  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* numbers.h (SCM_INEXACTP, SCM_REALP, SCM_COMPLEXP): Removed uses
	of SCM_SLOPPY_INEXACTP, SCM_SLOPPY_REALP and SCM_SLOPPY_COMPLEXP.

	* numbers.h, deprecated.h (SCM_SLOPPY_INEXACTP, SCM_SLOPPY_REALP,
	SCM_SLOPPY_COMPLEXP): Deprecated and moved from numbers.h to
	deprecated.h.

2003-09-06  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* eq.c (scm_eqv_p, scm_equal_p): Removed uses of
	SCM_SLOPPY_INEXACTP, SCM_SLOPPY_REALP and SCM_SLOPPY_COMPLEXP.

	* eq.c (scm_eqv_p, scm_equal_p): Reordered comparisons from
	0.0==some_expression to some_expression==0.0.  The latter is
	better readable.  The former is preferred by some people, since it
	leads to a compiler error when confusing == with =.  However, when
	using gcc, a warning will be issued if in an if-statement an
	assigment appears.  Since many Guile developers are using gcc,
	such errors will not remain unnoticed anyway.  We can therefore
	focus on better readability.

2003-09-04  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* tags.h: Added description of Guile's type system.  Removed some
	old and misleading comments.

2003-09-04  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* unit.c (scm_cvref): Eliminate unnecessary uses of SCM_NIMP,
	SCM_SLOPPY_REALP and SCM_SLOPPY_COMPLEXP.

2003-09-04  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* numbers.h (SCM_MAKINUM): Define in terms of scm_tc2_int.

	(SCM_INEXACTP, SCM_REALP, SCM_COMPLEXP): Define in terms of the
	respective SLOPPY macro.

2003-09-04  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* eq.c (scm_equal_p): Use SCM_TYP7 to check if an object is of
	type string, not SCM_TYP7S.

2003-09-03  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* numbers.c (scm_lognot): Correction to docstring, ones-complement not
	2s-complement.

	* stime.c (scm_strptime): Add comment about glibc strptime %s and
	current timezone requiring SCM_DEFER_INTS.

2003-08-30  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	if file to be loaded does not begin with a `-'.  (Thanks to Aaron
	VanDevender for the patch!)

2003-08-30  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* numbers.c (scm_lognot): Rewrite using ~ and mpz_com, for directness
	and to have non-integer types rejected as per other logical funcs.

2003-08-28  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* gc.h (scm_remember_upto_here_1): Revise comments on the asm form.

2003-08-23  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* simpos.c (scm_system): Remove SCM_DEFER_INTS, system() should be
	thread safe, and could take a long time too.

	* numbers.c (scm_difference): Correction to bignum - negative inum.

2003-08-14  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* gc.h (scm_remember_upto_here_1, scm_remember_upto_here_2)
	[__GNUC__]: Use volatile asm macros rather than a function call.
	* gc.c (scm_remember_upto_here_1, scm_remember_upto_here_2): Undefine
	macros while defining functions.

	* simpos.c (getenv): Use <stdlib.h> for prototype.

	* srcprop.c (scm_source_properties): Return plist from hash if it's a
	list set by source-properties! rather than an SRCPROPS object,

2003-07-29  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* properties.c (scm_primitive_property_ref): In docstring, note
	parameters to not-found-proc, use hyphens rather than underscores for
	that parameter name.
	(scm_primitive_property_set_x): In docstring, VAL is the value
	parameter not CODE.

2003-07-27  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	escaping the symbol name properly.  Thanks to Paul Jarc!

	* posix.h (scm_setgroups): New prototype.
	* posix.c (scm_setgroups): New.  Thanks to Paul Jarc!
	(scm_getgroups): Handle groups ids that don't fit into a fixnum.
	Don't use SCM_WRITABLE_VELTS.

	* gc.h (SCM_GC_SET_CELL_BVEC): New.

	Matthias Koeppe!

	* __scm.h (SCM_C_INLINE_KEYWORD): New.
	* numbers.c: Use it in place of SCM_C_INLINE so that the code
	compiles when SCM_C_INLINE is undefined.

2003-07-24  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* __scm.h: Reformulated the architecture and compiler properties
	in terms of properties of scm_t_bits and SCM variables rather than
	in terms of c standard types.  This is since it is not known which
	of the standard types scm_t_bits and SCM variables will be defined
	to.

2003-07-24  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* numbers.c (scm_angle): Use scm_flo0 for non-negative inum, bignum
	and real.

2003-07-18  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* numbers.c (scm_product): In complex * bignum, correction to
	REAL/IMAG fetch, x is the complex, not y.

2003-07-13  Mikael Djurfeldt  <djurfeldt@nada.kth.se>

	* numbers.c (scm_odd_p, scm_even_p): Bugfix: Treat result of
	scm_inf_p test as Scheme values.
	(scm_sum): Bugfix: Normalize bignum created from a negative bignum
	and a positive inum.
	Use GNU indentation style.

2003-07-12  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* values.c (scm_values): Build lists of length 1 by using
	scm_list_1 instead of using scm_cons.

2003-07-10  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	defines of INTPTR_MAX and UINTPTR_MAX, combine conditionals for
	scm_t_bits and scm_t_signed_bits to avoid any chance of one and not
	the other using intptr_t.

2003-07-08  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* numbers.c (scm_make_polar): Use sincos, when available.
	(scm_magnitude): Use hypot.

	* ports.c (scm_char_ready_p, scm_peek_char): In docstrings, don't use
	@footnote since it doesn't go through to guile-procedures.txt.

	* threads.c (scm_call_with_new_thread): In docstring, use "( )"
	outside @var to quieten makeinfo, and use @code.

2003-07-06  Han-Wen Nienhuys  <hanwen@cs.uu.nl>

	* gc-malloc.c (decrease_mtrigger): new function
	(increase_mtrigger): new function, separate debug registering and
	mtrigger administration.
	(scm_gc_realloc): bugfix: do mtrigger administration before the
	actual realloc, for the realloc might invalidate a GC-d segment of
	memory. Thanks to Sam Hocevar for pointing this out.
	(scm_gc_realloc): use scm_malloc_reregister instead of
	unregistering and registering in sequence.

2003-07-03  Han-Wen Nienhuys  <hanwen@cs.uu.nl>

	* __scm.h (SCM_ASSERT): change "else" expansion to "do { } while (0)"

2003-07-02  Han-Wen Nienhuys  <hanwen@cs.uu.nl>

	* __scm.h (SCM_ASRTGO): add "else" to macro expansions with if
	clauses.

2003-06-29  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	* deprecated.h (SCM_OPDIRP, scm_fport, scm_option, scm_srcprops,
	scm_srcprops_chunk, scm_info_frame, scm_stack, scm_array,

	* continuations.c: Redeclaration of getcontext() via the
	__asm__ ("getcontext") directive.

	<sys/ucontext.h>.

2003-06-21  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* numbers.c (_GNU_SOURCE): #define, to get C99 things.
	(scm_asinh, scm_acosh, scm_atanh, scm_truncate, $asinh, $acosh,
	$atanh, truncate): Use C library asinh, acosh, atanh and trunc, when
	available.
	(scm_inexact_to_exact): Expand isfinite to its definition !xisinf.
	(isfinite): Remove, conflicts with C99 isfinite().

2003-06-19  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	<unistd.h>.
	(scm_getspecific, scm_setspecific): Made these two function
	real part of the API.

	* posix.c (s_scm_putenv): Added some code to make a
	(putenv "FOO="), i.e. setting an empty string, work also on
	Win32 systems.  Thanks to Kevin Ryde for the proposal.

2003-06-12  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* posix.c (scm_putenv): Free temporary ptr in mingw unset.  Add
	freebsd to comment about need to use unsetenv.

2003-06-02  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	* ports.c (scm_peek_char): Safe the column of the port around the
	getc/ungetc calls.  Thanks to Dr. Peter Ivanyi!

2003-06-07  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* tags.h: Use inttypes.h and stdint.h when available, for INTPTR_MAX
	and friends required by scm_t_bits setups.

2003-06-06  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* tags.h (scm_tc2_int): Added.

	scm_tcs_closures): Hard coded values replaced by symbolic ones.

2003-06-05  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* eval.c: Partially undid my patch from 2003-05-31.  This patch
	caused the segfault referenced in the previous changelog entry.

2003-06-05  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* tags.h: Fixed comment about the immediate type code layout.

	* eval.c: Fixed handling of non-special instructions.  Without
	this patch, guile will segfault on (#\0) and similar instructions.

2003-06-05  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* numbers.c (scm_max, scm_min): For inum, bignum and real, if other
	operand is NaN, then return NaN.  Also avoid passing NaN to mpz_cmp_d.

	* read.c (scm_input_error): Pass arg list parameter to scm_error_scm,
	rather than SCM_EOL.  Needed by "Unknown # object" case in scm_lreadr.

2003-06-04  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* __scm.h, gc-card.c (SCM_DEBUG_DEBUGGER_SUPPORT,
	SCM_DEBUG_DEBUGGING_SUPPORT): Renamed macro
	SCM_DEBUG_DEBUGGER_SUPPORT to SCM_DEBUG_DEBUGGING_SUPPORT and
	generalized it to apply not only to C level functions but also to
	scheme level functions.

	* debug.c, debug.h, eval.c (make-iloc, scm_make_iloc, iloc?,
	scm_iloc_p, dbg-make-iloc, scm_dbg_make_iloc, dbg-iloc?,
	scm_dbg_iloc_p): Moved functions scm_make_iloc, scm_iloc_p to
	eval.c, made them available under SCM_DEBUG_DEBUGGING_SUPPORT == 1
	only and renamed them to scm_dbg_make_iloc, scm_dbg_iloc_p,
	respectively.

	* deprecated.h, eval.c, eval.h (SCM_ILOC00, SCM_IDINC,
	SCM_IDSTMSK): Deprecated.  The macro definitions are moved from
	eval.h into eval.c and a copy is placed into deprecated.h.

	* eval.c, eval.h (SCM_MAKE_ILOC): Removed from eval.h and placed
	into eval.c. This definition was not part of the API in any
	officially released version of guile and thus does not need to go
	through a phase of deprecation.

2003-06-02  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* deprecated.c, deprecated.h, eval.c, eval.h (scm_s_expression,
	scm_s_test, scm_s_body, scm_s_bindings, scm_s_variable,
	scm_s_clauses, scm_s_formals): Deprecated.  In eval.c the
	definitions are make static and renamed from scm_s_xxx to s_xxx.
	In deprecated.c the original definitions are copied.

	* deprecated.h, eval.c, eval (SCM_EVALIM2, SCM_EVALIM, SCM_XEVAL,
	SCM_XEVALCAR): Deprecated.  The macro definitions are moved from
	eval.h into eval.c and a copy (slightly modified to work in user
	code) is placed into deprecated.h.

	* eval.c: Use the local static s_xxx definitions instead of the
	scm_s_xxx definitions throughout.

2003-06-01  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	This set of patches separates the representation of the cxr family
	of functions (car, cdr etc.) from the dsubr family of functions
	(i. e. functions that take a double precision floating point
	argument).  Further, the algorithm for handling the cxr function
	is improved.

	* eval.c (SCM_CEVAL, SCM_APPLY, scm_trampoline_1), numbers.c
	(scm_asinh, scm_acosh, scm_atanh, scm_truncate, scm_round, floor,
	ceil, sqrt, fabs, exp, log, sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, sinh,
	cosh, tanh), objects.c (scm_class_of), procprop.c
	(scm_i_procedure_arity), ramap.c (scm_array_map_x), tags.h
	(scm_tc7_dsubr, scm_tcs_subrs): Introduce scm_tc7_dsubr as new
	typecode for the dsubr family of functions.

	* ramap.c (ramap_cxr, ramap_dsubr): Renamed ramap_cxr to
	ramap_dsubr.

	* eval.c (SCM_CEVAL, SCM_APPLY, call_cxr_1), pairs.c
	(scm_init_pairs): Make use of the (now usable) second cell element
	of a scm_tc7_cxr function to implement the cxr family of functions
	more efficiently.

2003-05-31  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* eval.c (SCM_CEVAL, SCM_APPLY, scm_trampoline_0,
	scm_trampoline_1, scm_trampoline_2): Postpone error cases to the
	end of an if-else-if-sequence of checks.

2003-05-30  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* eval.c (SCM_CEVAL): Improved readability of call-with-values
	execution.  Generalize apply_closure to apply_proc and use that
	for call-with-values.

2003-05-30  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* eval.c (SCM_CEVAL): Avoid one level of indirection when applying
	a non closure.

2003-05-30  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* posix.c (s_scm_putenv): Use the new HAVE_UNSETENV
	appropriately for mingw32 hosts.

	* numbers.h: Defining copysign(), isnan() and finite() to
	be prefixed by a single '_' for mingw32 hosts.

2003-05-30  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	(scm_init_numbers): Initialize it.
	(scm_logcount): Use it and mpz_hamdist to count zeros for negatives.

2003-05-29  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* win32-dirent.c: Use malloc() instead of scm_malloc().

	* stime.c (s_scm_strftime): Add a type cast to avoid compiler
	warning.

	* posix.c (s_scm_putenv): Disable use of unsetenv() for the
	mingw32 build.

	* modules.c (s_scm_module_import_interface): Renamed local
	variable interface to _interface.  Seems like 'interface'
	is a special compiler directive for the mingw32 compiler.

	* mkstemp.c: Provide prototype to avoid compiler warning.

	* load.c (s_scm_search_path): Fixed absolute and relative
	path detections for native Windows platforms.

	* gc.h, threads.h: Export some more symbols using SCM_API (necessary
	to build on mingw32).

	* gc-freelist.c ("s_scm_map_free_list",
	"s_scm_gc_set_debug_check_freelist_x"): Fixed use of FUNC_NAME.

	* fports.c (fport_fill_input): Disable use of
	fport_wait_for_input() on Win32 platforms.

	* filesys.c (s_scm_basename): Fixed __MINGW32__ code.

	proper function object and the correct number of arguments are now
	performed in the application part of SCM_CEVAL.

	(scm_badformalsp):  Removed.

2003-05-25  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* deprecated.c (scm_read_and_eval_x):  Fixed C99-ism.

2003-05-22  Mikael Djurfeldt  <djurfeldt@nada.kth.se>

	* num2integral.i.c (NUM2INTEGRAL): Avoid warning about conditional
	always being false by inserting preprocessor conditional.  (Thanks
	to Bruce Korb.)

	* __scm.h (SCM_STACK_PTR): New macro. (Cast argument through
	(void *) in order to avoid an aliasing warning; thanks to Bruce
	Korb.)

	* stackchk.h (SCM_STACK_OVERFLOW_P): Use SCM_STACK_PTR.

	* threads.c (suspend, launch_thread, scm_threads_mark_stacks): Use
	SCM_STACK_PTR.

	* threads.c (scm_threads_mark_stacks): Bugfix: Changed
	thread->base --> t->base.

	* eval.c (SCM_CEVAL): Don't cast argument of SCM_STACK_OVERFLOW_P.

2003-05-20  Marius Vollmer  <marius.vollmer@uni-dortmund.de>

	* deprecated.h, deprecated.c (scm_makstr, scm_makfromstr,
	scm_variable_set_name_hint, scm_builtin_variable,
	scm_internal_with_fluids, scm_make_gsubr,
	scm_make_gsubr_with_generic, scm_create_hook, SCM_LIST0,

	scm_set_smob_mfpe, scm_strprint_obj, scm_read_0str, scm_eval_0str,
	SCM_CHARS, SCM_UCHARS, SCM_LENGTH): Re-added from the release_1_6
	branch.  Some have been slightly rewritten.
	(scm_i_object_chars, scm_i_object_length): New, to support
	SCM_CHARS, SCM_UCHARS, and SCM_LENTH.

2003-05-19  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* eval.c (scm_m_do, unmemocopy, SCM_CEVAL):  Reversed order of
	names and inits in the memoized code of do.

2003-05-19  Mikael Djurfeldt  <djurfeldt@nada.kth.se>

	* c-tokenize.lex (yyget_lineno, yyget_in, yyget_out, yyget_leng,
	yyget_text, yyset_lineno, yyset_in, yyset_out, yyget_debug,
	yyset_debug, yylex_destroy): Added prototypes (otherwise we'll get
	a compilation error if error-on-warning is enabled).

2003-05-17  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	* c-tokenize.lex: Gobble up complete lines after a '#'.  This
	removes preprocessor directives from the snarfage that might
	otherwise confuse us.  These directives appear when compiling with
	"-g3", for example.

2003-05-16  Han-Wen Nienhuys  <hanwen@cs.uu.nl>

	* ChangeLog: add my surname

	* srcprop.c (scm_finish_srcprop): use

	* backtrace.c (scm_display_error_message): Introduced fancy
	printing with max level 7 and length 10.  (Purpose: avoid printing
	gigantic objects in error messages.)

	* print.c, print.h (scm_i_port_with_print_state): New function.

	* print.c (scm_iprin1, scm_printer_apply,
	scm_port_with_print_state): Use scm_i_port_with_print_state.

	Use current names in definitions.

2003-05-10  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* numbers.c (scm_num_eq_p, scm_less_p): Don't pass NaN to mpz_cmp_d.

	* numbers.c (scm_integer_length): On negative bignums, adjust
	mpz_sizeinbase to account for it looking at absolute value where we
	want ones-complement.

	* numbers.c (scm_gcd): In bignum/inum, don't pass yy==0 to mpz_gcd_ui
	since we're only using the ulong return value, and x might not fit.

2003-05-06  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* eval.c, eval.h, read.c, read.h (scm_sym_dot): Moved from eval to
	read.  This will allow to make the definition in read.c static.

2003-05-06  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* eval.c, eval.h, evalext.c, evalext.h (scm_m_undefine): Moved
	from evalext to eval.  This will allow to make some of the
	definitions in eval.c static.

2003-05-06  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* numbers.c (scm_difference): In inum - bignum, handle negative inum.
	(scm_logcount): Use mpz_com, not mpz_neg.

2003-05-04  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	The purpose of this patch is to make guile's internal memoizers
	distinguishable from memoizing macros created on the scheme level
	or from user provided primitive memoizing macros.  The reason is,
	that the internal memoizers are the only ones that are allowed to
	transform their scheme input into memoizer byte code, while all
	other memoizing macros may only transform scheme code into new
	scheme code.

	To achieve this, a new macro type 'builtin-macro!' is introduced.
	Currently, 'builtin-macro!'s are handled as memoizing macros, but
	this will change when the memoizer and executor are separated.

	* macros.[ch] (scm_i_makbimacro): New.

	* macros.h (SCM_BUILTIN_MACRO_P): New.

	* macros.c (macro_print, scm_macro_type): Support builtin-macro!s.

	* eval.c, goops.c: All of guile's primitive memoizing macros are
	primitive builtin-macros now.

	* eval.c (scm_macroexp, SCM_CEVAL): Make sure the primitive
	builtin-macros are handled equally to memoizing macros.

2003-05-04  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	* throw.c (scm_ithrow): Remove "asm volatile" hack.  It used to
	work around a bug in GCC 2.95.2 but is now a bug in itself.

2003-05-02  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.de>

	* deprecated.h (scm_rstate, scm_rng, SCM_SLOPPY_CONSP,
	SCM_SLOPPY_NCONSP, scm_tc7_ssymbol, scm_tc7_msymbol,
	scm_tcs_symbols): New.

2003-04-30  Marius Vollmer  <marius.vollmer@uni-dortmund.de>

	* deprecated.h, deprecated.c (scm_protect_object,
	scm_unprotect_object, SCM_SETAND_CAR, SCM_SETOR_CAR,

	scm_ensure_user_module, scm_load_scheme_module, scm_port,
	scm_ptob_descriptor, scm_port_rw_active,
	scm_close_all_ports_except): New.

	* ports.c (scm_c_port_for_each): New function, mostly copied from
	scm_port_for_each.
	(scm_port_for_each): Reimplemented using scm_c_port_for_each.

2003-04-28  Mikael Djurfeldt  <djurfeldt@nada.kth.se>

	macro was introduced in anticipation of GOOPS method compilation
	code.)

	* goops.c: Removed binding of @dispatch.

2003-04-28  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* eval.c, goops.c (@dispatch, @slot-ref, @slot-set!): Move the
	instructions that bind the macros on the scheme level back to
	goops.c in order to make sure again that the bindings go into the
	(oop goops) module and are not visible from the outside.

2003-04-27  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* eval.c: Non functional change: Separated R5RS and non-R5RS

	This set of patches contains no functional changes, only debatable
	minor stylistic ones.  Still, in order to prepare a patch between
	my local copy and the CVS version, I decided to submit the changes
	below.  Then, the patch will hopefully only contain relevant
	modifications :-)

	* eval.c (iqq): Added const specifier.

	* eval.c (scm_trampoline_0, scm_trampoline_1, scm_trampoline_2):
	Use NULL instead of 0 to indicate that a pointer is returned.

	sort.test.

	(quicksort, compare_function, scm_restricted_vector_sort_x,
	scm_sorted_p, scm_merge, scm_merge_list_x, scm_merge_x,

	scm_merge_vector_step, scm_stable_sort_x, scm_stable_sort,
	scm_sort_list_x, scm_sort_list): Use trampoline mechanism from
	eval.c.

	(subr2less, lsubrless, closureless, applyless, scm_cmp_function,
	cmp_fun_t): Removed.

	(compare_function): Added.

	* sort.c (quicksort, SWAP, stack_node): Replaced pointer
	arithmetics with index arithmetics.  Changed quicksort to work on
	an array of SCM values instead of an array of characters.  Avoid
	bytewise copying of SCM elements.  Avoid allocating memory on the
	stack with alloca.  Fixed some comments.

2003-04-21  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	scm_t_list_cell_struct, scm_t_list_cell, scm_t_double_cell,
	scm_gc_marked_p, scm_gc_get_card, scm_gc_get_bvec): Fixed
	functions such that they check if the object is a non-immediate.
	Further, renamed identifiers to use the scm_dbg_ prefix and made
	their inclusion into the lib dependent of the
	SCM_DEBUG_DEBUGGER_SUPPORT compile time option.

2003-04-21  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	scm_m_generalized_set_x, scm_init_evalext): Move the declaration
	and definition of the memoizer for the generalized set! macro from
	evalext.[ch] to eval.[ch].  Use the SCM_SYNTAX snarfer macro to
	define the macro object.

	* eval.c, eval.h (s_set_x, scm_s_set_x, scm_m_set_x,
	scm_m_generalized_set_x): Since now scm_s_set_x is only used in

	snarf macros.

	* numbers.c (scm_abs): Use SCM_PRIMITIVE_GENERIC.  (This is only a
	testing example.  All uses of SCM_GPROC should be converted.)

	* procprop.c (scm_stand_in_scm_proc): Use scm_assq instead of
	scm_assoc.

	* eq.c (scm_equal_p): Turned into a primitive generic.

2003-02-27  Rob Browning  <rlb@defaultvalue.org>

2003-02-24  Mikael Djurfeldt  <djurfeldt@nada.kth.se>

	This fixes a serious GC bug, introduced during the latest
	reorganization of the GC, which disabled freeing of structs and
	GOOPS objects:

	SCM_EOL.
	(scm_struct_prehistory): Move scm_free_structs to
	scm_before_mark_c_hook.

	* gc-card.c (sweep_card): Check that we haven't swept structs on
	this card before.  That can happen if scm_i_sweep_all_segments has
	been called from some other place than scm_igc.

2003-02-19  Mikael Djurfeldt  <djurfeldt@nada.kth.se>

	* environments.c (DEFAULT_OBARRAY_SIZE): Changed from 137 to 31
	(since hash tables now adapt their size).

	* modules.c (scm_modules_prehistory): Changed from 2001 to 1533
	(current number of prehistory bindings; hashtable code will select
	a prime which is greater than this value).

	* symbols.c (scm_symbols_prehistory): Changed from 1009 to 2139
	(current number of initial symbols).

	* properties.c (scm_init_properties): Don't specify size of

	scm_object_whash.

	* keywords.c (scm_init_keywords): Don't specify a hash table size.

	* hooks.c (scm_c_hook_add): Fixed bug in append mode.

	The following changes introduce the use of resizable hash tables
	throughout Guile.  It also renames the old *-hash-table* functions
	to *-alist-vector* and places them, together with the rest of the
	weak vector support, in the module (ice-9 weak-vector).  We should
	probably introduce a new, better, API for weak references, for
	example "weak pairs" a la MIT-Scheme.  (In Chez scheme, they even
	look like and are used like ordinary pairs.)

	* environments.c (obarray_enter, obarray_retrieve, obarray_remove,
	leaf_environment_fold, obarray_remove_all): Use hashtable
	accessors.

	* gc.c (scm_init_storage): Moved hook initialization to

	Removed.
	(scm_make_weak_key_hash_table, scm_make_weak_value_hash_table,
	scm_make_doubly_weak_hash_table): Moved here from weaks.c.

	* init.c (scm_init_guile_1): Removed call to scm_init_weaks; Added
	calls to scm_storage_prehistory and scm_hashtab_prehistory.

	* modules.c (module-reverse-lookup): Use hashtable accessors.

	* symbols.c, symbols.h (scm_i_hash_symbol): New function.

	* weaks.c, weaks.h (scm_make_weak_key_alist_vector,
	scm_make_weak_value_alist_vector,
	scm_make_doubly_weak_alist_vector): New functions.

	* weaks.c (scm_init_weaks_builtins): New function.

	* weaks.h (SCM_WVECTF_WEAK_KEY, SCM_WVECTF_WEAK_VALUE,
	SCM_WVECTF_NOSCAN, SCM_WVECT_WEAK_KEY_P, SCM_WVECT_WEAK_VALUE_P,
	SCM_WVECT_NOSCAN_P): New macros.

	* weaks.c (scm_scan_weak_vectors):  Use SCM_WVECT_WEAK_KEY_P
	and SCM_WVECT_WEAK_VALUE_P.

	* weaks.c, weaks.h (scm_i_allocate_weak_vector): Renamed from
	allocate_weak_vector and exported.

2003-02-13  Mikael Djurfeldt  <djurfeldt@nada.kth.se>

	* hashtab.c: Undid thread safety.  (We decided that it's better to
	let the user explicitly protect the tables (or not) according what
	is suitable for the application.)

2003-02-12  Mikael Djurfeldt  <djurfeldt@nada.kth.se>

	* hashtab.c (scm_hash_fn_remove_x, scm_internal_hash_fold): Made
	thread safe and handle resizing tables.
	(scm_ihashx, scm_sloppy_assx, scm_delx_x): Removed
	SCM_DEFER/ALLOW_INTS.

2003-02-11  Mikael Djurfeldt  <djurfeldt@nada.kth.se>

	* hashtab.c (scm_vector_to_hash_table,
	scm_c_make_resizing_hash_table, scm_make_hash_table): New
	functions.
	(scm_hash_fn_get_handle, scm_hash_fn_create_handle_x): Made thread
	safe and handle resizing tables.

	* weaks.c (scm_make_weak_key_hash_table,
	scm_make_weak_value_hash_table, scm_make_doubly_weak_hash_table):
	Size argument made optional.  Return resizable table if not
	specified.

2003-02-10  Mikael Djurfeldt  <djurfeldt@nada.kth.se>

	* eval.c (scm_trampoline_0, scm_trampoline_1, scm_trampoline_2):

2003-02-05  Mikael Djurfeldt  <djurfeldt@nada.kth.se>

	* debug.c (scm_procedure_source): Handle all objects for which
	procedure? is #t.  (Thanks to Bill Schottstaedt.)

2003-01-23  Mikael Djurfeldt  <djurfeldt@nada.kth.se>

	* futures.c (mark_futures): Don't need to mark data of recycled
	futures.
	(scan_futures, cleanup_undead): Be smarter about marking
	futures---avoid unnecessary passes through future lists.

	* futures.h, futures.c: New files; Introduced recycling of
	futures.  For fine-grained threading this lifts performance to
	another level.  We can now use parallelization in inner loops of
	Guile programs without impossible overhead.

	* threads.h, threads.c: Moved futures to their own file.

	* Makefile.am (libguile_la_SOURCES): Added futures.c.
	(DOT_X_FILES): Added futures.x.

	waiting also for simple condition variables.

	* goops.c (TEST_CHANGE_CLASS): Use scm_change_object_class instead
	of calling the procedure change-object-class.

2003-01-09  Mikael Djurfeldt  <djurfeldt@nada.kth.se>

	* ramap.c (scm_ramapc): Typo in error message.

2003-01-08  Mikael Djurfeldt  <djurfeldt@nada.kth.se>

	scm_lreadparen): Support reading vectors with Elisp syntax if
	SCM_ELISP_READ_EXTENSIONS is defined.  (SCM_ELISP_READ_EXTENSIONS
	is not currently defined, and there isn't even a configure switch
	to enable it yet.)

2002-12-26  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* Makefile.am (c-tokenize.o): Refer to source via $< so that vpath
	builds work.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Added version.h.in.

2002-12-21  Mikael Djurfeldt  <djurfeldt@nada.kth.se>

	This change makes it possible for one thread to do lazy sweeping
	while other threads are running.  Now only the mark phase need to
	have all threads asleep.  We should look further into this issue.
	Presently, I've put the locking of scm_i_sweep_mutex at
	"conservative" places due to my current lack of knowledge about
	the garbage collector.  Please feel free to restrict these regions
	further to allow for maximal parallelism!

	* gc.c, gc.h (scm_i_sweep_mutex): New mutex.

	* gc.c (scm_gc_for_newcell), gc-malloc.c (scm_realloc,
	scm_gc_register_collectable_memory): Substitute locking of
	scm_i_sweep_mutex for calls to scm_i_thread_put_to_sleep.
	(scm_igc): Lock sweep mutex here instead of in callers; Calls to
	scm_i_thread_put_to_sleep/scm_i_thread_wake_up used to demarkate
	the single-thread section (which now only contains the mark
	phase).
	(scm_gc): Don't lock sweeo mutex here since scm_igc locks it;
	Removed SCM_DEFER/ALLOW_INTS.  Simply call scm_igc directly.

	* threads.c (gc_section_mutex): Removed.

2002-12-19  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@kvast.blakulla.net>

	* threads.c (create_thread): Clear parent field in root state in
	order not to unnecessarily remember dead threads.

	* eval.c (call_subr2o_1, call_lsubr2_2): New functions.
	(scm_trampoline_1, scm_trampoline_2): Use them.

2002-12-18  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@kvast.blakulla.net>

	thread_admin_mutex locked during GC.

	* pthread-threads.c, pthread-threads.h: Improvements to debugging

	support for debugging mutex operations.

	* threads.c (scm_thread): Removed filed joining_threads.
	(thread_print): Print thread number as well as address of thread
	structure.
	(scm_join_thread): Bugfix.
	(scm_lock_mutex, scm_try_mutex, scm_unlock_mutex,
	scm_timed_wait_condition_variable, scm_signal_condition_variable,
	scm_broadcast_condition_variable): Use the low-level API.
	(scm_all_threads): Return copy of thread list (to prevent
	unintended destruction).
	(scm_threads_prehistory): Initialize heap_mutex of fake thread.

	* pthread-threads.c, pthread-threads.h, threads.c: Fixes to
	pthread "native" recursive mutex support.

2002-12-15  Mikael Djurfeldt  <djurfeldt@nada.kth.se>

	* __scm.h (SCM_DEFER_INTS, SCM_ALLOW_INTS): New definitions.
	Simply lock a thread C API recursive mutex.
	(SCM_NONREC_CRITICAL_SECTION_START,
	SCM_NONREC_CRITICAL_SECTION_END, SCM_REC_CRITICAL_SECTION_START,
	SCM_REC_CRITICAL_SECTION_END): Removed.

	* eval.c: Replaced SOURCE_SECTION_START / SOURCE_SECTION_END with
	direct calls to scm_rec_mutex_lock / unlock around the three calls
	to scm_m_expand_body.

	* eval.c, eval.h (promise_free): New function.
	(scm_force): Rewritten;  Now thread-safe; Removed
	SCM_DEFER/ALLOW_INTS.

	* pthread-threads.h: Added partially implemented plugin interface
	for recursive mutexes.  These are, for now, only intended to be
	used internally within the Guile implementation.

	* pthread-threads.c: New file.

	* threads.c: Conditionally #include "pthread-threads.c".

	* eval.c, eval.h (scm_makprom, scm_force): Rewritten to be
	thread-safe;

	* snarf.h (SCM_MUTEX, SCM_GLOBAL_MUTEX, SCM_REC_MUTEX,
	SCM_GLOBAL_REC_MUTEX): New macros.

	* eval.c, threads.c, threads.h, snarf.h: Rewrote critical section
	macros---use mutexes instead.

	* tags.h (SCM_IM_FUTURE): New tag.

	* eval.c (scm_m_future): New primitive macro.
	(SCM_CEVAL): Support futures.
	(unmemocopy): Support unmemoization of futures.

	* print.c (scm_isymnames): Name of future isym.

	* version.c: Unmade some changes to my private copy that got
	committed by mistake.

2002-12-11  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@kvast.blakulla.net>

	* gc-malloc.c, gc.h, init.c: Reverted gc-malloc change of
	2002-12-10.

	* gc.c (scm_igc): Don't call scm_i_thread_invalidate_freelists.

	* gc.c (scm_gc_sweep): Call it here instead, which is a more
	logical place.

	* threads.c (create_thread): Remember root object until the handle
	of the new thread is on all_threads list.

	* root.c (scm_make_root): Moved copying of fluids until after
	creation of root handle so that the fluids are GC protected.  Also
	removed the critical section.

2002-12-10  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@kvast.blakulla.net>

	* gc-malloc.c, gc.h (scm_gc_malloc_prehistory): New function.

	* gc-malloc.c (malloc_mutex): New mutex.
	(scm_gc_malloc_prehistory): Initialize it.
	(scm_realloc): Serialize call to realloc
	(scm_calloc): Same for calloc.
	Thanks to Wolfgang Jaehrling!
	(Now we have to make sure all calls to malloc/realloc are made
	through scm_malloc.)

	* init.c (scm_init_guile_1): Call scm_gc_malloc_prehistory.

	* threads.c (really_launch): Release heap (to prevent deadlock).
	(create_thread): Release heap before locking thread admin mutex.

2002-12-10  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@kvast.blakulla.net>

	* threads.c (scm_i_thread_invalidate_freelists): New
	function.

	* gc.c (scm_igc): Call scm_i_thread_invalidate_freelists.

	* modules.c (scm_export): Inserted a return statement.

2002-12-10  Han-Wen Nienhuys  <hanwen@cs.uu.nl>

	* modules.c (scm_export): new function

	* gc-card.c: add a note about malloc()/free() overhead.

2002-12-10  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@kvast.blakulla.net>

	* Makefile.am (c-tokenize.$(OBJEXT)): Don't look for c-tokenize.c
	in srcdir.

2002-12-10  Mikael Djurfeldt  <djurfeldt@nada.kth.se>

	These changes remove scm_ints_disabled (which hasn't has any
	effect in Guile for quite some time).

	* async.c, error.h (scm_ints_disabled): Removed.

	* gc.c (scm_gc_for_newcell), init.c (scm_init_guile_1),
	root.c (scm_internal_cwdr), gdbint.c (SCM_BEGIN_FOREIGN_BLOCK,
	SCM_END_FOREIGN_BLOCK): Don't touch scm_ints_disabled.
	(old_ints): Removed.

	* __scm.h (SCM_DEFER_INTS, SCM_ALLOW_INTS): Define as a recursive
	critical section.
	(SCM_REDEFER_INTS, SCM_ALLOW_INTS): Define as SCM_DEFER_INTS and
	SCM_ALLOW_INTS.

2002-12-09  Mikael Djurfeldt  <djurfeldt@nada.kth.se>

	* threads.c (scm_mutex_lock, scm_cond_wait, scm_cond_timedwait):
	Removed accidental #if 0 around these functions.

	These changes are the start of support for preemptive
	multithreading.  Marius and I have agreed that I commit this code
	into the repository although it isn't thoroughly tested and surely
	introduces many bugs.  The bugs should only be exposed when using
	threads, though.  Signalling and error handling for threads is
	very likely broken.  Work on making the implementation cleaner and
	more efficient is needed.

	* __scm.h (SCM_ALLOW_INTS_ONLY): Removed.
	(SCM_NONREC_CRITICAL_SECTION_START,
	SCM_NONREC_CRITICAL_SECTION_END, SCM_REC_CRITICAL_SECTION_START,
	SCM_REC_CRITICAL_SECTION_END): New macros.
	(SCM_CRITICAL_SECTION_START/END): Defined here.

	* eval.c: Insert SOURCE_SECTION_START / SOURCE_SECTION_END around
	the three calls to scm_m_expand_body.

	* gc.h: #include "libguile/pthread-threads.h";
	(SCM_FREELIST_CREATE, SCM_FREELIST_LOC): New macros.

	* gc.c (scm_i_freelist, scm_i_freelist2): Defined to be of type
	scm_t_key;

	* gc.c, gc-freelist.c, inline.h: Use SCM_FREELIST_LOC for freelist
	access.

	* gc-freelist.c (scm_gc_init_freelist): Create freelist keys.

	* gc-freelist.c, threads.c (really_launch): Use
	SCM_FREELIST_CREATE.

	* gc-malloc.c (scm_realloc, scm_gc_register_collectable_memory):

	* gc.c (scm_i_expensive_validation_check, scm_gc,
	scm_gc_for_newcell): Put threads to sleep before doing GC-related
	heap administration so that those pieces of code are executed
	single-threaded.  We might consider rewriting these code sections
	in terms of a "call_gc_code_singly_threaded" construct instead of
	calling the pair of scm_i_thread_put_to_sleep () and
	scm_i_thread_wake_up ().  Also, we would want to have as many of
	these sections eleminated.

	* init.c (scm_init_guile_1): Call scm_threads_prehistory.

	* inline.h: #include "libguile/threads.h"

	* pthread-threads.h: Macros now conform more closely to the
	pthreads interface.  Some of them now take a second argument.

	* threads.c, threads.h: Many changes.

2002-12-09  Mikael Djurfeldt  <djurfeldt@nada.kth.se>

	* Makefile.am (version.h): Changed $^ --> $< in rule for
	version.h.

2002-12-08  Rob Browning  <rlb@defaultvalue.org>

	* version.h.in (SCM_MICRO_VERSION): use @--@ substitution now.
	(SCM_MINOR_VERSION): use @--@ substitution now.
	(SCM_MICRO_VERSION): use @--@ substitution now.
	(scm_effective_version): new function prototype.

	* version.c (scm_effective_version): new function, also add
	effective-version.

	* Makefile.am (schemelibdir): VERSION -> GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION.
	(libpath.h): use GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION to compute
	SCM_LIBRARY_DIR.
	(version.h): generate this here rather than configure.in.  This
	approach tracks source edits better (i.e. more immediately).
	Might be worth considering for other .in files too.

2002-12-02  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	Reorganized thread package selection.  A thread package now only
	implements a small set of pthread like functions and Guile
	implements the rest on top of that.  Guile's implementation is
	what the "coop-pthreads" package has been previously.  Support for
	"coop" threads has been removed until I get time to add it again.

	* Makefile.am (libguile_la_SOURCES): Removed iselect.c.
	(noinst_HEADERS): Removed coop-threads.c, coop-threads.h, coop.c,
	null-threads.c, coop-pthreads.c.
	(modinclude_HEADERS): Removed coop-defs.h, coop-pthreads.h.  Added
	pthread-threads.h.

	* validate.h (SCM_VALIDATE_THREAD): Moved to threads.h.

	* threads.h: Do not include "libguile/coop-defs.h".  Include
	"libguile/pthread-threads.h" for USE_COPT_THREADS.  Removed
	(previously deprecated) C level thread API prototypes.  They are
	now in the thread package specific headers, "null-threads.h" and
	"pthread-threads.h".
	(SCM_VALIDATE_THREAD, SCM_VALIDATE_MUTEX, SCM_VALIDATE_CONDVAR):
	New.
	(scm_threads_init): Removed.
	(SCM_CRITICAL_SECTION_START, SCM_CRITICAL_SECTION_END,
	SCM_THREAD_SWITCHING_CODE, scm_i_switch_counter,
	SCM_I_THREAD_SWITCH_COUNT): Define here.
	(scm_single_thread_p): Removed.
	(scm_call_with_new_thread): Take two args directly instead of list
	of two args.
	(scm_i_thread_data, scm_i_set_thread_data, SCM_THREAD_LOCAL_DATA,
	SCM_SET_THREAD_LOCAL_DATA): Define here.

	* threads.c: Merged with "coop-pthreads.c".

	* null-threads.h: Implement pthread-like API as a set of macros.

	* pthread-threads.h: New, implement pthread-like API by deferring
	to pthread itself.

	* init.c (scm_init_guile_1): Do not call scm_init_iselect, which
	has been lost in the reorganization.

2002-12-01  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@linnaeus>

	The following change makes it possible to move procedure
	application dispatch outside inner loops.  The motivation was
	clean implementation of efficient replacements of R5RS primitives
	in SRFI-1.

	The semantics is clear: scm_trampoline_N returns an optimized
	version of scm_call_N (or NULL if the procedure isn't applicable
	on N args).

	Applying the optimization to map and for-each increases efficiency
	noticeably.  For example, (map abs ls) is 8 times faster than
	before.

	* eval.h (scm_t_trampoline_1, scm_t_trampoline_2): New types.

	* eval.c, eval.h (scm_trampoline_1, scm_trampoline_2): New functions.

	* eval.c (call_subr2_2, call_lsubr_2, call_closure_2): New functions;
	(map, for-each): Handle also application on two args as a special
	case; Use trampolines.

	Other changes:

	* sort.c (scm_cmp_function): Choose subr2less for scm_tc7_subr_2o;
	(subr2oless): Removed.
	(scm_restricted_vector_sort_x): Use scm_return_first to keep the
	vector GC protected.

	* eval.c (check_map_args): Use scm_out_of_range_pos instead of
	scm_out_of_range.

2002-11-24  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* evalext.[ch] (scm_m_undefine, undefine):  Deprecated.

2002-11-17  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@linnaeus>

	* debug.c (scm_make_iloc): Added missing "return".

2002-11-17  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* strports.c (scm_eval_string_in_module): Validate second arg to
	be a module.  Thanks to Arno Peters!

2002-11-16  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* modules.c (scm_env_top_level, scm_lookup_closure_module,
	module_variable, scm_module_lookup_closure,
	scm_module_transformer, scm_sym2var, scm_module_reverse_lookup,
	scm_system_module_env_p):  Don't compare SCM values with C
	operators == or !=.  Avoid SCM_IMP predicates.  Prefer !SCM_FALSEP
	over SCM_NFALSEP.

2002-11-16  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* eval.h (SCM_MAKE_ILOC):  New macro.

	* debug.c (scm_make_iloc):  Use SCM_MAKE_ILOC instead of computing
	the iloc bitpattern here.

2002-11-14  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@linnaeus>

	* coop-pthreads.c, coop-pthreads.h: scm_internal_select should be
	part of the API, otherwise it's difficult to write Guile
	extensions using non-blocking I/O => moved #include
	"libguile/iselect.h" from coop-pthreads.c --> coop-pthreads.h.

	* coop-pthreads.c (scm_unlock_mutex): Changed s_lock_mutex -->
	s_unlock_mutex.

2002-11-10  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* __scm.h (USE_THREADS, GUILE_ISELECT): Do not define here.  They
	are defined in configure.in.

	* threads.c: Removed SCM_API from function definitions.  SCM_API
	is only for declarations.

2002-11-07  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@linnaeus>

	* coop-pthreads.h: Added support for thread specific data to the
	generic C API for the coop-pthreads case.

	* threads.c, threads.h (scm_cond_init): Undo unintentional API
	change.
	(scm_cond_broadcast): Added missing function.

2002-11-04  Marius Vollmer  <marius.vollmer@uni-dortmund.de>

	* coop.c (coop_next_runnable_thread): Removed, wich should have
	happened when GUILE_ISELECT was hard-wired.

2002-11-03  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* Makefile.am (libguile_la_SOURCES): Added threads.c
	(DOT_DOC_FILES): Added threads.doc.
	(DOT_X_FILES): Added threads.x.
	(EXTRA_libguile_la_SOURCES): Removed threads.c.
	(noinst_HEADERS): Added coop-pthreads.c.
	(modinclude_HEADERS): Added coop-pthreads.h.

	* __scm.h (USE_THREADS, GUILE_ISELECT): Define when
	SCM_DEBUG_DEPRECATED.  Removed their use thru-out Guile.

	* iselect.c: Include "_scm.h" before testing HAVE_UNISTD_H.
	Thanks to Bill Schottstaedt!

	* numbers.c (scm_integer_expt): Make 0^z == 0 for z != 0.

	* _scm.h (HAVE_RESTARTABLE_SYSCALLS): Do define even when
	SCM_COPT_THREADS is defined.
	(SCM_SYSCALL): Use EINTR-expection version when SCM_COPT_THREADS
	is defined.

	* coop-pthreads.c: Some harmless renamings of internal stuff.
	(create_thread): New, generalized version of
	scm_call_with_new_thread.
	(scm_call_with_new_thread): Use it.
	(scm_spawn_thread): New, use create_thread.

2002-11-02  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* coop-pthreads.c, coop-pthreads.h: Redone completely, you might
	start testing it now.

	* _scm.h: Include <errno.h< so that SCM_SYSCALL is correctly
	defined when HAVE_RESTARTABLE_SYSCALLS is not defined.
	(HAVE_RESTARTABLE_SYSCALLS): Do not define when USE_COPT_THREADS
	is defined.

2002-10-27  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* scmsigs.c (signal_cell_handlers, install_handler_data,
	scm_delq_spine_x, really_install_handler, install_handler): New
	scheme for triggering signal handlers, to simplify take_signal.
	(take_signal): Simplified, to avoid race conditions.
	(scm_sigaction_for_thread): Use new Scheme.  Validate that thread
	hasn't exited yet.

	* async.c (scm_async_click): Reset pending_asyncs, handle
	signal_asyncs.  Don't set cdr of a non-signal async to #f.
	(scm_i_queue_async_cell): Do not check cdr of cell for #f, queue
	always.  Set pending_asyncs.
	(scm_system_async_mark_for_thread): Check that thread has not
	exited.
	(scm_unmask_signals, decrease_block): Call scm_async_click after
	block_asyncs becomes zero.

	* __scm.h (SCM_ASYNC_CLICK): Check pending_asyncs instead of
	active_asyncs.

	* root.h (scm_root_state): Added pending_asyncs and signal_asyncs
	fields.
	* root.c (root_mark): Mark them.
	(make_root): Initialize them.

	* iselect.c, iselect.h: Replaced GUILE_ISELECT with
	USE_COOP_THREADS.
	(scm_internal_select): Define one version for USE_COOP_THREADS and
	one for USE_NULL_THREADS.
	(scm_init_iselect): Likewise.

        * inline.h (scm_cell, scm_double_cell): Also allow
	USE_COPT_THREADS to not protect the slot initializers.

	* init.c (scm_init_guile_1): Call scm_init_thread_procs.  This is
	because threads need to be initialized before the stack, but
	gsubrs such as scm_timed_condition_variable_wait can only be
	created later.

	* threads.h: Include "coop-pthreads.h" when requested.
	(scm_threads_make_mutex, scm_threads_lock_mutex,
	scm_threads_unlock_mutex, scm_threads_monitor): Removed, they were
	not implemented anyway.
	(scm_init_thread_procs, scm_try_mutex,

	registered procedures.
	(scm_wait_condition_variable, scm_timed_wait_condition_variable):
	Use the latter as the procedure for "wait-condition-variable",
	thus offering a optional timeout parameter to Scheme.
	(scm_wait_condition_variable): Implement in terms of
	scm_timed_wait_condition_variable.
	(scm_mutex_init, scm_mutex_lock, scm_mutex_trylock,

	scm_cond_wait, scm_cond_timedwait, scm_cond_signal,
	scm_cond_broadcast, scm_cond_destroy): Implement in terms of
	scm_make_mutex, etc, and deprecate.
	(scm_init_threads): Do not create smobs, leave this to
	scm_threads_init.  Do not include "threads.x" file.
	(scm_init_thread_procs): New, include "threads.x" here.

	* null-threads.h (scm_null_mutex, scm_null_mutex_init,
	scm_null_mutex_lock, scm_null_mutex_unlock,

	(scm_mutex_init, scm_mutex_lock, scm_mutex_unlock, scm_cond_init,
	scm_cond_wait, scm_cond_signal, scm_cond_broadcast,
	scm_cond_destory): Do not define, they are now deprecated and
	handled by threads.{h,c}.

	* null-threads.c (scm_null_mutex, scm_null_cond): Define here.
	(scm_threads_init): Create smobs here, using the appropriate
	sizes.
	(block): Removed, now unused.
	(scm_c_thread_exited_p): New.
	(scm_null_mutex_init, scm_null_mutex_lock, scm_null_mutex_unlock,
	scm_null_mutex_destroy, scm_null_condvar_init,
	scm_null_condvar_wait, scm_null_condvar_signal,
	scm_null_condvar_destroy): Removed and updated users to do their
	task directly.
	(scm_try_mutex, timeval_subtract,
	scm_timed_wait_condition_variable,
	scm_broadcast_condition_variable): New.
	(scm_wait_condition_variable): Removed.

	* coop-defs.h (coop_m): Added 'level' field.
	(scm_t_mutex, scm_mutex_init, scm_mutex_lock, scm_mutex_trylock,
	scm_mutex_unlock, scm_mutex_destroy, scm_t_cond, scm_cond_init,
	scm_cond_wait, scm_cond_timedwait, scm_cond_signal,
	scm_cond_broadcast, scm_cond_destroy, struct timespec): Do not
	define.
	(coop_condition_variable_broadcast): New.

	* coop-threads.c (scm_threads_init): Create smobs here, using the
	appropriate sizes.
	(scm_c_thread_exited_p, scm_try_mutex,
	scm_timed_wait_condition_variable,
	scm_broadcast_condition_variable): New.
	(scm_wait_condition_variable): Removed.

	* coop.c (coop_new_mutex_init): Initialize level.
	(coop_mutex_trylock, coop_mutex_lock, coop_mutex_unlock): maintain
	level.
	(coop_condition_variable_signal): Renamed to
	coop_condition_variable_broadcast and reimplemented in terms of
	that.  Thus...
	(coop_condition_variable_broadcast): New.

	* goops.c (hell_mutex): Reimplemented using scm_make_mutex, etc.

	* coop-pthreads.h, coop-pthreads.c: New, but unfinished.

2002-10-21  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* null-threads.c: Include <time.h>.  Also, use <...> for inclusion
	of system headers.

	* async.c, goops.h, modules.h, validate.h (SCM_MAKE_VALIDATE_MSG):
	New.  Use it instead of SCM_MAKE_VALIDATE in lots of places to
	give better error messages.  Thanks to Bill Schottstaedt!

2002-10-19  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* evalext.h, evalext.c (scm_definedp, scm_defined_p):  Renamed

2002-10-15  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* Makefile.am: Replaced "$<" in non-pattern rules with its value.

	* gc-segment.c (scm_i_get_new_heap_segment): use float in stead of
	unsigned numbers for computing minimum heap increment. This
	prevents weird results when a a negative minimum increment is

	the pre-processor without extracting the input file name.

2002-08-23  Han-Wen Nienhuys  <hanwen@cs.uu.nl>

	* gc-segment.c (scm_i_get_new_heap_segment): Oops. We want segment
	length *at* least SCM_MIN_HEAP_SEG_SIZE, not at most.

2002-08-22  Han-Wen Nienhuys  <hanwen@cs.uu.nl>

	* gc.h, gc.c: make scm_cells_allocated unsigned again. Thanks to

	(scm_c_eval_string_in_module): New.
	Thanks to Ralf Mattes for the suggestion!

2002-08-09  Han-Wen Nienhuys  <hanwen@cs.uu.nl>

	message and abort.

	* gc-mark.c ("scm_gc_mark_dependencies"): idem.

	* ports.c ("scm_new_port_table_entry"): return a boxed SCM in

	implementation).
	(scm_gc_calloc): new function

2002-08-04  Han-Wen Nienhuys <hanwen@cs.uu.nl>

	* ports.c (scm_new_port_table_entry): init port entry to 0
	completely.

	* ports.c (scm_new_port_table_entry): change function from
	scm_add_to_port_table. This prevents cells with null-pointers from
	being exposed to GC.

	* vports.c (scm_make_soft_port) strports.c (scm_mkstrport),
	fports.c (scm_fdes_to_port): Use scm_new_port_table_entry().

        sweeping. More documentation in workbook/newgc.text

2002-07-25  Marius Vollmer  <marius.vollmer@uni-dortmund.de>

	* random.c (rstate_free): Return zero.

2002-07-24  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* environments.c (remove_key_from_alist):  Removed.

	(obarray_remove):  Simplified.

2002-07-24  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* continuations.h: ia64: Include <signal.h> before
	<sys/ucontext.h>.

2002-07-21  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* modules.c (scm_sym2var):  Don't compare SCM values with ==.

2002-07-21  Han-Wen Nienhuys <hanwen@cs.uu.nl>

	* goops.c (scm_compute_applicable_methods): use
	scm_remember_upto_here_1 iso scm_remember_upto_here

	* macros.c: include deprecation.h

	* vectors.c (scm_vector_move_right_x): remove side effect in
	macro arg.
	(scm_vector_move_left_x): idem.

	* net_db.c, posix.c, socket.c: variable naming: change ans to
	result.

	* eval.c (SCM_CEVAL), macros.c (macro_print, scm_makmacro,
	scm_sym_macro, scm_macro_type), macros.h (scm_makmacro):
	Deprecated the special kind of built-in dynamic syntax transformer
	that was inaccurately named "macro".  Note:  The built-in syntax
	transformers that are named "mmacro" or "memoizing-macro" still
	exist, and it is these which come much closer to what one would
	call a macro.

2002-07-13  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	* eval.c (unmemocopy): Fix for
	1001-local-eval-error-backtrace-segfaults (unmemoization crash
	with internal definitions and local-eval).

2002-07-12  Gary Houston  <ghouston@arglist.com>

	* dynl.c: Don't define stub procedures if DYNAMIC_LINKING is not
	defined.  They don't do anything useful, especially since the
	only case where DYNAMIC_LINKING is undefined seems to be
	when --with-modules=no is given to configure, which is basically
	requesting that the "dynamic linking module" be omitted.

	* Makefile.am (libguile_la_SOURCES): move dynl.c from
	libguile_la_SOURCES to EXTRA_libguile_la_SOURCES.

	* extensions.c (load_extension): check DYNAMIC_LINKING for
	scm_dynamic_call.
	* init.c (scm_init_guile_1): check DYNAMIC_LINKING for
	scm_init_dynamic_linking.

2002-07-10  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* guile.c, iselect.h, net_db.c, posix.c, socket.c: No need to
	check for Cygwin when including <winsock2.h>, this is already
	check for by configure.  Thus, revert change from 2002-07-07.

2002-07-10  Gary Houston  <ghouston@arglist.com>

	* eq.c: include <string.h>
	* dynl.c: docstring editing.

2002-07-09  Gary Houston  <ghouston@arglist.com>

	* dynl.c (scm_dynamic_call): docstring editing.

2002-07-08  Rob Browning  <rlb@defaultvalue.org>

	* gc_os_dep.c: HURD fixes.

2002-07-07  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	Crosscompiling and Cygwin fixes by Jan Nieuwenhuizen.  Thanks!

	* Makefile.am: Override default rule for c-tokenize.$(OBJECT);
	this should be compiled for BUILD host.
	Override default rule for
	guile_filter_doc_snarfage$(EEXECT); this should run on BUILD host.
	Add missing $(EXEEXT) to guile_filter_doc_snarfage invocation.
	(snarf2checkedtexi): Use GUILE_FOR_BUILD instead of preinstguile.

	* guile.c, iselect.h, net_db.c, posix.c, socket.c: Do not include
	<winsock2.h> on Cygwin even when we have it.

2002-07-01  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* __scm.h (SCM_CAUTIOUS), eval.c (scm_eval_args, deval_args,
	SCM_CEVAL):  Removed compile time option SCM_CAUTIOUS to clean up
	the code.  Full number of arguments checking of closures is
	mandatory now.  However, the option to disable the checking has
	most probably not been used anyway.

2002-06-30  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* __scm.h (SCM_RECKLESS), backtrace.c (SCM_ASSERT), debug.c
	(scm_debug_options), eval.c (scm_lookupcar, scm_lookupcar1,
	scm_badargsp, SCM_CEVAL, SCM_APPLY, scm_map, scm_for_each),
	feature.c (scm_init_feature), gsubr.c (scm_gsubr_apply), numbers.c
	(scm_logand, scm_logior, scm_logxor, scm_i_dbl2big), srcprop.c
	(scm_source_properties, scm_set_source_properties_x,
	scm_source_property):  Removed compile time option SCM_RECKLESS to
	clean up the code.  Full number of arguments checking of closures
	is mandatory now.  However, the option to disable the checking has
	most probably not been used anyway.

	* srcprop.c (scm_source_properties, scm_set_source_properties_x,
	scm_source_property): Use !SCM_CONSP instead of SCM_NCONSP.

2002-06-30  Gary Houston  <ghouston@arglist.com>

	* dynl.c: Removed all SCM_DEFER_INTS/SCM_ALLOW_INTS, which won't
	do anything useful.  Added a comment about need for a mutex if
	pre-emptive threading is supported.

	* posix.c (scm_convert_exec_args), dynl.c
	(scm_make_argv_from_stringlist): static procs: 1) renamed both to
	allocate_string_pointers.  2) simplified: don't reallocate the
	strings, just make an array of pointers 3) avoid memory leaks on
	error 4) let the procedure report errors in its own name.
	Consequences: 1) the procedures now assume that SCM strings are
	nul-terminated, which should always be the case.  2) Since strings
	are not reallocated, it's now possible for strings passed to
	dynamic-args-call to be mutated.

2002-06-28  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* __scm.h, eval.c, eval.h:  Removed compile time option
	MEMOIZE_LOCALS to clean up the code.  Now, caching of local
	variable positions during memoization is mandatory.  However, the
	option to disable the caching has most probably not been used
	anyway.

2002-06-18  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* print.c (scm_simple_format): Print missing part of format before
	~% control.  Thanks to Daniel Skarda!

2002-05-22  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* numbers.c (mem2ureal): When returning an inexact zero, make sure
	it is represented as a floating point value so that we can change
	its sign.

        From John W. Eaton  <jwe@bevo.che.wisc.edu>

	* numbers.c (idbl2str): Don't omit sign when printing negative zero.

2002-05-14  Thien-Thi Nguyen  <ttn@giblet.glug.org>

	* gc_os_dep.c: For I386/OPENBSD, allow for `__i386__'
	in addition to `i386'.  Thanks to Dale P. Smith.

2002-05-08  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	NaN.
	(scm_inexact_to_exact): Signal error when converting a NaN.

2002-05-06  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* posix.c (scm_putenv): Handle removing variables explicitely by
	calling unsetenv.

	From John W. Eaton.

	[SCO && ! HAVE_ISINF] (isinf): New function.
	(xisinf, xisnan): New functions.
	(IS_INF): Delete.

	(guile_ieee_init): New function.
	(scm_inf, scm_nan): New functions.
	(idbl2str): Handle Inf and NaN.	Remove funny label and
	corresponding gotos.
	(ALLOW_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO): New macro.
	(scm_divide): Allow division by zero to occur if
	ALLOW_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO is defined.
	Handle bignums and ints as special cases.

	Additional stuff by me:

	(scm_divide): Only allow divides by inexact zeros.  Dividing by
	exact zeros still signals an errors.

2002-04-22  Thien-Thi Nguyen  <ttn@giblet.glug.org>

	cpp_sig_symbols.c.

2002-04-16  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* guile-snarf.in: Do not clean input file.  This would write to
	the $(srcdir) during a VPATH build, which is not allowed.  It also
	isn't needed since it only works when an output filename has been
	specified and in that case we don't need to clean the input file
	because the output file will already exist.

2002-03-31  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* guile-snarf: Install the trap for removing $cleanfile only when
	the value of $cleanfile is actually known.

	stdout.  When no "-o" option is given, use "-" as the output
	filename (i.e., stdout).  Only 'clean' the inputfile or remove the
	output file on error when the output file name is not "-".  Define
	the preprocessor macro SCM_MAGIC_SNARFER while snarfing.

	argument checking order for set! to locals, variables and symbols.
	Improvements to control structure.  Removed some uses of arg1 and
	arg2 as temporary variables.

2002-03-15  Thien-Thi Nguyen  <ttn@giblet.glug.org>

	* guile-snarf.in: Remove "--compat=1.4" support.
	Add "-d" and "-D" support.

	* debug.c (scm_debug_options), eval.c
	(scm_eval_options_interface), read.c (scm_read_options): Change
	incorrect @var in docstring to @code.

2002-03-14  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* unif.c (singp): Use SCM_REALP instead of SCM_SLOPPY_REALP.

	* snarf.h (SCM_SNARF_INIT): Add "^:^" after code so that
	guile-snarf can remove trailing non-init code.

	of SCM_MAX_FRAME_SIZE as a bit mask; it isn't used like this.

	SCM_NULLP || SCM_NILP instead of checks against (removed)
	scm_lisp_nil.  Removed switch cases for SCM_IM_NIL_IFY,
	SCM_IM_T_IFY, SCM_IM_0_COND, SCM_IM_0_IFY, SCM_IM_1_IFY.

	* lang.c (scm_nil_cons, scm_nil_car, scm_nil_cdr, scm_null,
	scm_m_while, scm_nil_eq): Commented out; I don't think we need

	getprotoent, setprotoent, endprotoent): New functions.
	Appropriate replacements for M$-Windows.

	* numbers.c (SIZE_MAX, PTRDIFF_MAX, PTRDIFF_MIN): Reintroduced
	these definitions for GUILE_DEBUG.

	* net_db.c: Include "win32-socket.h" if compiling with a native
	M$-Windows compiler.  Include some pieces of code (protoent and

	native M$-Windows compiler.

2001-11-20  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* modules.c (scm_c_export): Do nothing when the first argument is

2001-11-18  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	* vectors.c (scm_vector_move_left_x, scm_vector_move_right_x):
	Rewrite docstrings without reference to substring-move-left/right,
	since the latter no longer exist.

2001-11-17  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* eval.c:  Removed bogus comment about acros.

	(scm_unmemocar):  Use !SCM_CONSP instead of SCM_IMP.
	Minimize scope of local variable.  Eliminate dependency on
	macro DEBUG_EXTENSIONS.

	(scm_m_body):  Issue 'bad body' message rather than 'missing
	expression' message.

	(scm_m_quote):  Eliminate unnecessary copying.

	checking of the body to scm_m_body.

	(scm_m_do):  Move comment to function header.  Rename arg1 to
	binding.  Made the code a bit easier to read.

	(evalcar):  Removed.

	(iqq):  Added a comment.  Changed the depth parameter to
	unsigned.  Use size_t for vector lengths.  Make sure vector object
	is gc protected as long as its contents are read.  Add some syntax

	syntax.  Renamed 'proc' to 'name'.  Eliminate dependency on macro
	DEBUG_EXTENSIONS.  Simplified code a bit.  Eliminate SICP code.

	(scm_m_letrec1):  Removed.  Part of the functionality is taken
	over by the new function 'transform_bindings'.

	(transform_bindings):  New function.  Takes over some of the
	functionality of removed function 'scm_m_letrec1', namely to split
	a list of bindings into a reversed list of variables and a list of
	initializers.

	(scm_m_letrec):  Call 'transform_bindings'.

	(scm_m_let):  Minimized scope of local variables.  Renamed 'proc'
	to 'temp' and 'arg1' to 'binding'.  Eliminated redundant SCM_NIMP
	test.  Use 'transform_bindings'.  Fixed scoping error with named
	let (Thanks to Aubrey Jaffer for reporting the bug and to Neil
	Jerram for suggesting the fix).  Cleaned up the control structure
	a bit.

	(scm_m_expand_body):  Use 'transform_bindings'.  Eliminated
	unnecessary consing.  Eliminated unnecessary
	SCM_DEFER/ALLOW_INTS.

	(SCM_CEVAL):  Un-obfuscated some loops.

2001-11-16  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	* gc.h (scm_unhash_name): Old declaration removed.

	* eval.c (s_scm_eval): Change @var{primitive-eval} to
	@code{primitive-eval}.

	* feature.c, vectors.c, net_db.c, unif.c, weaks.c, struct.c,
	version.c, alist.c, ports.c, ramap.c, unif.c, strings.c, list.c:
	Change @deffnx lines in docstrings to say {Scheme Procedure}
	rather than primitive or procedure.

	* posix.c (scm_execl), filesys.c (scm_close), unif.c
	(scm_array_set_x, scm_array_contents, scm_uniform_array_read_x,
	scm_bit_set_star_x, scm_bit_invert_x), ramap.c (scm_array_fill_x,
	scm_array_for_each, scm_array_index_map_x), vectors.c (scm_vector,
	scm_make_vector, scm_vector_to_list, scm_vector_fill_x), strop.c
	(scm_string_split, scm_string_ci_to_symbol), strings.c
	(scm_string_p), sort.c (scm_merge), print.c (scm_newline),
	macros.c (scm_macro_type), alist.c (scm_acons, scm_assq):
	Docstring fixes and improvements reflecting edits that have been
	made in the reference manual source.

	* objprop.c (scm_object_properties, scm_set_object_properties_x,
	scm_object_property, scm_set_object_property_x): Remove invalid
	@deffnx lines for corresponding procedure property primitives.

	These changes add a @deffnx C function declaration and function
	index entries for each Guile primitive to the copy of the doc
	snarf output that is used for reference manual synchronization.
	Online help is unchanged.

	* snarf.h (SCM_SNARF_DOCS): Output primitive's C function name.
	(SCM_DEFINE, SCM_DEFINE1, SCM_REGISTER_PROC): Supply to C function
	name to SCM_SNARF_DOCS.

	* guile-snarf-docs-texi.in: Pass the shell script's arguments into
	snarf-check-and-output-texi.

	* Makefile.am (guile-procedures.texi): New rule.
	(BUILT_SOURCES, guile.texi, guile-procedures.txt, CLEANFILES):
	Changed so that the last stage of doc snarfing is now performed
	twice, once to produce guile-procedures.txt for online help, and
	once to produce guile.texi for reference manual synchronization.

2001-11-15  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* eval.c (RETURN):  Wrap in do{}while(0) in order to make it
	safely usable as a single statement followed by a ';', for example
	in an if statement.

	(SCM_CEVAL, SCM_APPLY):  Clean up code using 'RETURN'.

2001-11-13  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	* random.c (scm_random_solid_sphere_x,

	* modules.c (scm_c_export): Call va_end after collecting the
	symbols.

	* strop.h, strop.c (scm_substring_move_left_x,
	scm_substring_move_right_x): Removed.

	* __scm.h (HAVE_UINTPTR_T, HAVE_PTRDIFF_T, HAVE_LONG_LONG,
	HAVE_LONG_LONGS): Define to "1" when defining them, to mirror what
	configure does.

2001-11-12  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* numbers.c: Document macros to define when including
	num2integral.i.c.  MAX_VALUE and MIN_VALU are no longer used, we
	now rely on SIZEOF_ macros that have been figured out at
	configure time.

	* num2integral.i.c: Adapt to new interface.
	(NUM2INTEGRAL): Test whether a fixnum can be represented in the
	target type by casting it and checking whether it is still the
	same.  Do not try to handle bignums for integral types that are
	smaller than fixnums.  When handling bignums, collect the
	magnituse first into a unsigned type, and correctly check for
	overflow.
	(INTEGRAL2BIG): Do not use MIN_VALUE explicitely by observing that
	only -MIN_VALUE can still be negative of all negative numbers (in
	twos-complement).

	* tags.h (SIZEOF_SCM_T_BITS): Define it appropriately.

	* __scm.h: Define HAVE_UINTPTR_T, HAVE_PTRDIFF_T and
	HAVE_LONG_LONG depending on whether their size is non-zero.

2001-11-11  Thien-Thi Nguyen  <ttn@glug.org>

	(scm_make_struct_layout), random.c (scm_random,
	scm_random_solid_sphere_x, scm_random_hollow_sphere_x, strop.c
	(scm_i_index): Remove superfluous whitespace from end of docstring
	lines.

	* filesys.c (scm_select), guardians.c (scm_guardian_greedy_p),
	strings.c (scm_make_string), variable.c (scm_make_variable,
	scm_make_undefined_variable, scm_variable_p, scm_variable_set_x,
	scm_variable_bound_p), scmsigs.c (scm_setitimer, scm_getitimer),
	posix.c (scm_crypt), struct.c (scm_make_vtable_vtable), hashtab.c
	(scm_hash_fold), ports.c (scm_port_for_each): Remove superfluous
	newline at end of docstrings.

	* modules.c (scm_set_current_module): Add missing newline to
	docstring.

2001-11-07  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* win32-socket.[ch]: New files.  Defines Winsock-API error codes
	and makes them available through Guile.  That is because the
	Winsock-API does not store its errors in `errno' and thus cannot
	return error messages via `strerror (errno)'.

	* socket.c (scm_init_socket): Initialize `win32-socket' part
	here under M$-Windows.

	* numbers.h: Added missing declaration of
	`scm_sys_check_number_conversions()'.

	* error.c: Local definition of SCM_I_STRERROR and SCM_I_ERRNO
	and use in `(strerror)' and `(system-error)'.

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_libguile_la_SOURCES): Added
	`win32-socket.[ch]' to extra source and header files.

2001-11-06  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* script.c (scm_shell_usage, scm_compile_shell_switches): Prepend
	a call to turn-on-debugging when --debug has been given instead of
	turning it on directly.  Also, handle new `--no-debug' option,
	which might suppress the call to turn-on-debugging.

2001-11-05  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* struct.c (s_scm_struct_vtable_p): Corrected docstring.

2001-11-04  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* Makefile.am (libguile_la_LIBADD): Added $(THREAD_LIBS_LOCAL)
	here (was at guile_LDADD) which describes the dependency
	correctly and allows a clean build on Win32.

	* __scm.h (SCM_API): Follow-up patch.  Renamed __FOO__ macros
	into FOO.

	* __scm.h: USE_DLL_IMPORT indicates the usage of the DLL
	import macros for external libraries (libcrypt, libqthreads,
	libreadline and libregex).

	* coop-defs.h: Include <winsock2.h> for `struct timeval'.

	* posix.c (flock): Added support for flock() in M$-Windows.

	* guile.c (SCM_IMPORT): Follow-up patch.  Use SCM_IMPORT instead
	of __SCM_IMPORT__.

	* fports.c (getflags): Differentiate reading and writing pipes
	descriptors.

	* filesys.c (S_IS*): Redefine all of the S_IS*() macros for
	M$-Windows.

	* coop.c (coop_condition_variable_timed_wait_mutex): Use
	conditionalized error code if `ETIMEDOUT' is not available.
	(scm_thread_usleep): Remove bogus declaration of `struct timeval
	timeout'.

	* numbers.c (PTRDIFF_MIN): Moved this definition where it actually
	belongs.  That is because NO_PREPRO_MAGIC gets undefined after
	each inclusion of `num2integral.i.c'.
	(SIZE_MAX): Define NO_PREPRO_MAGIC if SIZE_MAX is undefined.

2001-11-03  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* eval.c (scm_m_begin): Allow `(begin)`, with no subforms.
	(SCM_CEVAL): Evaluate an empty `begin' to SCM_UNSPECIFIED.

2001-11-02  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@linnaeus>

	* print.c (scm_iprin1): Mark print state as revealed when
	dispatching to generic write or display.

	* unif.c (scm_ra2contig): Fixed memory overwrite bug.

2001-11-02  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	Support for native Win32.  Thanks to Stefan Jahn!

        * Makefile.am: Add win32-uname.c, win32-uname.h, win32-dirent.c
	and win32-dirent.h to extra source and header files.  These
	include the uname() and the POSIX dirent interface implementation
	for M$-Windows.  Put `-no-undefined' into LDFLAGS to support
	linkers which do not allow unresolved symbols inside shared
	libraries.  Corrected `guile_filter_doc_snarfage$(EXEEXT)'
	dependency.

        * __scm.h: Defined SCM_API.  This macro gets prepended to all
        function and data definitions which should be exported or imported
        in the resulting dynamic link library in the Win32 port.

        * __scm.h, alist.h, arbiters.h, async.h, backtrace.h, boolean.h,

        vports.h, weaks.h:
        Prefixed each each exported symbol with SCM_API.

        * continuations.c: Added comment about the use of the extern
        declarations of {get,set}context() functions used in the ia64 port.

        * continuations.h, gc.c: `__libc_ia64_register_backing_store_base'
        is meant to be a `unsigned long *'.

        * filesys.c: Include `direct.h' if possible.  Use local
	`win32-dirent.h' for the native M$-Windows port.  Define S_IS*()
	macros for M$-Windows.  Implementation of `fstat_Win32()' which is
	able to differentiate between sockets and other file descriptors.
	Use this function as wrapper in `scm_fstat()'.  Fixed typo in
	`scm_dirname()'.

        * fports.c: Include `io.h' is possible.  Put `*fp' into referring
        statement block in `scm_fport_buffer_add()'.
        Some corrections in `getflags()'.

        * gdb_interface.h (GDB_INTERFACE): Also support __CYGWIN__.

        * guile.c: Make sure to define __SCM_IMPORT__ for shared library
        build on Win32.  Disable preloaded symbols on Win2 platforms.

        * ioext.c, ports.c: Include `io.h' is possible.

        * mkstemp.c: Include `process.h' is possible.

        * net_db.c: Disable extern declaration of `h_errno' for __CYGWIN__,
        too.
        Put `scm_return_entry()' into HAVE_GETSERVENT conditional.

        * posix.c: Remove unnecessary dirent includes and defines. Include
	local `win32-uname.h' for MinGW.  Extern declaration of
	`mkstemp()' for systems where it does not exists.  Make
	`getlogin()' available on M$-Windows.

        * scmsigs.c: Made `usleep()' avalable on MinGW.

        * stime.c: On M$-Windows `tzname[]' is known to be `_tzname[]'.

	* win32-dirent.c: Include "win32-dirent.h", not "dirent.h".

	* win32-uname.c: Include "win32-uname.h", not "uname.h".

2001-10-28  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@linnaeus>

	* unif.c (scm_uniform_array_read_x, scm_uniform_array_write):
	Don't apply scm_uniform_vector_length on arrays.

2001-10-14  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* eval.c (scm_lookupcar, scm_m_letstar, scm_m_do, iqq,
	scm_m_define, scm_m_letrec1, scm_m_let, scm_m_expand_body,
	scm_macroexp, unmemocopy, scm_eval_args, scm_deval_args,
	SCM_CEVAL, scm_map, scm_init_eval):  When building lists, prefer
	scm_list_<n> over scm_cons[2]?.

	(scm_unmemocar, scm_m_cond, scm_m_letstar, scm_m_letrec1,
	scm_m_let, scm_m_atbind, unmemocopy, SCM_CEVAL, SCM_APPLY):  Use
	SCM_C[AD][AD]R instead of explicit form.

	(scm_m_set_x, scm_m_cond, scm_m_letstar, scm_m_do):  Reordered
	comparison parameters.

	(scm_m_case, scm_m_cond, scm_m_letstar, scm_m_do, SCM_CEVAL):  Use
	!SCM_NULLP instead of SCM_NIMP.

	(scm_m_case):  Don't copy the form.  Renamed proc to clause and
	minimized its scope.  Renamed x to clauses.  Removed side
	effecting operation from macro call.

	(scm_m_cond):  Don't copy the form.  Renamed arg1 to clause and
	minimized its scope.  Renamed x to clauses.  Minimized the scope
	of variable 'len'.  Make sure the else clause is treated specially
	even in case of '=>' occurences.  Don't change the else to #t in
	order to be able to distinguish this case in the evaluator.  Leave
	type checking of the recipient to the evaluator.

	(scm_c_improper_memq):  Made the comment somewhat clearer.

	(scm_m_lambda):  Renamed proc to formals.  Removed unnecessary
	test for SCM_IM_LET at the place of the formal parameters.
	Simplified the formal parameter checking.

	(scm_m_letstar):  Added Comment.  Renamed proc to bindings.
	Renamed arg1 to binding and minimized its scope.  Eliminated
	unnecessary consing.

	(scm_m_do):  Renamed proc to bindings.  Minimized the scope of
	variable 'len'.

	(build_binding_list):  New static function.

	(unmemocopy):  Don't use SCM_TYP7 on pairs (it's unclean).
	Further, split up the 'letrec' unmemoizing code to the
	corresponding parts for 'do', 'let' and 'letrec', adding comments
	to each form.  Cleanup the handling of the do form (This removes
	some *real* code :-).

	(SCM_CEVAL):  Removed side effecting operation from macro call.
	Handle the 'else clause of the 'cond form specially - the symbol
	'else is not replaced with #t any more.

2001-10-14  Gary Houston  <ghouston@arglist.com>

	* version.c (scm_version): use sprintf instead of snprintf,
	for portability.  thanks to Bill Schottstaedt.

2001-10-14  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@linnaeus>

	* read.c (scm_lreadr): When user-defined hash procedure returns
	SCM_UNSPECIFIED: Fall back to standard handling instead of raising
	an exception.  (This prevents parsing of uniform vectors from
	interfering with parsing of numbers.)

2001-10-13  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* numbers.c: Set NO_PREPRO_MAGIC when defining our version of
	PTRDIFF_MIN.  Thanks to Ken Raeburn.

2001-10-07  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_libguile_la_SOURCES): Added "mkstemp.c".

	* eval.c (scm_m_atbind): First try to find the variable without
	defining it locally; when it has not been found, define it
	locally.

	* modules.c (module_variable): Pass over variables that exist but
	are unbound.

2001-10-06  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* backtrace.c (display_backtrace_file_and_line): Only use
	scm_basename when POSIX support is compiled in.  Thanks to Chris
	Cramer.

2001-10-13  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* numbers.c (mem2uinteger):  Return number read so far when coming
	across a hexdigit after having read a # or if not reading a hex
	value.  This will enable the calling code to correctly handle
	forms like 1e2.  (The background is, that the exponent markers d,
	e and f are also hexdigits.)  Thanks to Mikael Djurfeldt for
	providing this patch.

	(mem2complex):  Fix erroneous double-negation.  Now, numbers like
	1-i will be read correctly.

2001-10-12  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@linnaeus>

	* debug.c (scm_mem_to_proc): Fixed typo in previous change.

	* validate.h (SCM_VALIDATE_DOUBLE_DEF_COPY): New macro.

2001-10-12  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* print.c (scm_print_state_vtable, print_state_pool):
	Initialize.  These variables are now registered as gc roots.

	(scm_current_pstate):  Update documentation.

	(scm_current_pstate, scm_make_print_state, scm_free_print_state,
	scm_prin1, scm_init_print):  print_state_pool is registered as a
	gc root and thus does not need to be protected by a surrounding
	pair any more.

	(make_print_state):  The car of print_state_pool no longer holds
	the scm_print_state_vtable.

	(scm_current_pstate, scm_make_print_state, print_circref,
	scm_iprin1, scm_prin1, scm_iprlist):  Prefer !SCM_<foo> over
	SCM_N<foo>.

	(scm_prin1):  When building lists, prefer scm_list_<n> over
	scm_cons[2]?.

	(scm_iprlist):  Removed a redundant SCM_IMP test.

	(scm_simple_format):  Use SCM_EQ_P to compare SCM values.

2001-10-11  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* debug.c (scm_make_iloc):  Prefer !SCM_<foo> over SCM_N<foo>.

	(scm_memcons, scm_mem_to_proc):  When building lists, prefer
	scm_list_<n> over scm_cons[2]?.

	(scm_mem_to_proc):  Prefer SCM_CONSP over SCM_NIMP.

	(scm_procedure_name):  Use SCM_CADR instead of explicit form.

	(debugobj_print):  Coerce scm_intprint arg 1 to long, not int.
	Thanks to Rob Browning for the patch (see log entry 2001-09-21) -
	for some reason his patch didn't make it into the cvs.

2001-10-09  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* numbers.c (mem2decimal_from_point):  Cleaned up the parsing a
	little bit - should even be somewhat more accurate now.

2001-10-08  Rob Browning  <rlb@defaultvalue.org>

	* gc.c: support ia64 register backing store.
	(SCM_MARK_BACKING_STORE): new macro.

	* continuations.h: support ia64 register backing store.
	(struct scm_t_contregs): add ia64 register backing store.

	* continuations.c: support ia64 register backing store.
	(continuation_mark): mark ia64 register backing store.
	(continuation_free): free ia64 register backing store.
	(scm_make_continuation): capture ia64 register backing store.
	(copy_stack_and_call): copy ia64 register backing store.

2001-10-08  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* hashtab.c (scm_hash_fn_create_handle_x):  The result of assoc_fn
	is known to be #f if no entry is found.  Thus, use !SCM_FALSEP
	instead of SCM_NIMP to test for that case.

	* strings.h (SCM_SET_STRING_LENGTH):  Cast the length to
	scm_t_bits instead of long.

2001-10-06  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* tags.h (SCM_T_BITS_MAX, SCM_T_SIGNED_BITS_MAX,
	SCM_T_SIGNED_BITS_MIN): New.
	* numbers.h (SCM_MOST_POSITIVE_FIXNUM, SCM_MOST_NEGATIVE_FIXNUM):
	Use them to make these macros computable by the preprocessor.

	* num2integral.i.c (INTEGRAL2NUM): Let the preprocessor test
	whether the integral type fits in a fixnum, not the compiler.
	This removes a spurious compiler warning.  Also, honor the
	NO_PREPRO_MAGIC flag to suppress any preprocessor tests.  This is
	needed for `long long's.

	* numbers.c: Define NO_PREPRO_MAGOC when including
	num2integral.c.i for `long long' and `signed long long'.

2001-10-06  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@linnaeus>

	These changes fixes a race condition in the Guile coop - pthread
	compatibility code.

	* coop.c (mother_awake_p): New variable.
	(coop_create): Set mother_awake_p before creating or signalling
	mother; wait until mother is going to sleep before returning.
	(mother): Reset mother_awake_p before going to sleep.

2001-10-05  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* options.c (protected_objects, scm_init_options):  The content of
	protected_objects is now protected from garbage collection using
	scm_gc_register_root instead of scm_permanent_object.

	(get_option_setting):  New static function that	computes an option
	setting as it was formerly done in the function scm_options.

	(get_documented_option_setting):  New static function that
	returns option documentation as it was formerly done in the
	function scm_options.  Note that documentation C strings are no
	longer precomputed into SCM objects.  Instead, they are converted
	into SCM strings every time get_documented_option_setting is
	called.

	(change_option_setting):  New static functions that modifies the
	option setting as it was formerly done in the function
	scm_options.  The function is now exception safe, i. e. won't
	cause a memory leak when interrupted.  Further, only non-immediate
	option values are added to the protection list.

	(scm_options):  This function now has only the purpose to dispatch
	to to get_option_setting, get_documented_option_setting or
	change_option_setting, depending on the arguments given to
	scm_options.

	(scm_init_opts):  Don't convert documentation C strings into SCM
	strings.  Further, don't protect any object values:  They _must_
	be immediate values, otherwise there is no guarantee that they
	have not been collected before anyway.

	* options.[ch] (scm_t_option):  Made type unsigned, name into a
	constant char* and val into a scm_t_bits type.

	(scm_options, scm_init_opts):  The number of options is guaranteed
	to be larger or equal to zero.  Thus, the type is changed to
	unsigned.

2001-10-05  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* num2integral.i.c (NUM2INTEGRAL):  Eliminated some warnings about
	testing an unsigned value for being >= 0.

2001-10-05  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* numbers.h:  Removed old comment about using SCM_CAR to access
	non-pair cells.

	(SCM_MOST_POSITIVE_FIXNUM, SCM_MOST_NEGATIVE_FIXNUM):  Make sure
	the return value is signed.  Thanks to Brian Crowder for the bug
	report.

	(SCM_SRS):  Avoid unnecessary casting and don't unpack input
	values.  With this patch, SCM_SRS can be safely used for other
	types than scm_t_signed_bits.  However, it should still better be
	an internal macro and thus be renamed to SCM_I_SRS.

	(SCM_MAKINUM, SCM_INUM):  Use proper casting.

2001-10-03  Gary Houston  <ghouston@arglist.com>

	* continuations.h, unif.h: in the descriptions of the bit patterns
	of the heap cells, make bit 0 the least significant.

2001-09-25  Thien-Thi Nguyen  <ttn@glug.org>

	* chars.h (SCM_MAKE_CHAR): Use `scm_t_bits' instead of `intptr_t'.
	Thanks to Golubev I. N.

2001-09-25  Gary Houston  <ghouston@arglist.com>

	* ports.c (scm_drain_input): extended the docstring.  thanks to
	Alex Schroeder and Thien-Thi Nguyen.

2001-09-23  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@linnaeus>

	* validate.h (SCM_NUM2FLOAT, SCM_NUM2DOUBLE,
	SCM_VALIDATE_FLOAT_COPY, SCM_VALIDATE_DOUBLE_COPY): New
	macros. (The NUM names might soon change.)

	* numbers.h: Added missing declarations.

2001-09-22  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@linnaeus>

	* Makefile.am: Distribute num2float.i.c.

	* num2float.i.c: New file, multiply included by numbers.c, used
	to "templatize" the float <-> num conversion routines.

	* numbers.c: New functions: scm_num2float, scm_float2num,
	scm_num2double, scm_double2num.

2001-09-21  Rob Browning  <rlb@defaultvalue.org>

	* .cvsignore: really add version.h

	* strings.h (SCM_SET_STRING_LENGTH): coerce "l" to a long.
	Otherwise it fails on the alpha.  However, we might rather choose
	this size conditionally.

	* numbers.c (scm_gcd): change "k" to a long from an int.
	Otherwise it fails on the alpha.  However, we might rather choose
	this size conditionally.

	* error.c (scm_wta): coerce char* to intptr_t before int
	assignment.

	* debug.c (debugobj_print): coerce scm_intprint arg 1 to long, not
	int.

	* chars.h (SCM_MAKE_CHAR): coerce value to intptr_t.

2001-09-20  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@linnaeus>

	* numbers.c (scm_integer_expt): Accept inexact integer in second
	argument.  (Thanks to Bill Schottstaedt.)

2001-09-20  Rob Browning  <rlb@defaultvalue.org>

	* .cvsignore: add version.h

	* versiondat.h.in: removed (obsolete).

	* version.h.in: renamed from version.h.
	(SCM_GUILE_MAJOR_VERSION): new public macro.
	(SCM_GUILE_MINOR_VERSION): new public macro.
	(SCM_GUILE_MICRO_VERSION): new public macro.

	* version.h: renamed to version.h.in.

	* version.c
	(scm_major_version): support integer *_VERSION macros.
	(scm_minor_version): support integer *_VERSION macros.
	(scm_micro_version): support integer *_VERSION macros.
	(scm_version): support integer *_VERSION macros.

2001-09-20  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@linnaeus>

	* error.c, error.h: Made error keys globally accessible.
	Applications might want to test for these or use them in a direct
	call to scm_error.

	* num2integral.i.c (NUM2INTEGRAL): Report an error when these
	routines are passed an inexact.  This change in behavior is
	motivated by concordance with R5RS: It is more common that a
	primitive doesn't want to accept an inexact for an exact.

2001-09-17  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

        The following patch partially undoes my patch from 2001-06-30,
	where I added the function scm_gc_mark_cell_conservatively.  The
	function is buggy, since it breaks guile during conservative
	marking if a pointer on the stack points directly into the list of
	free cells on the heap:  With conservative cell marking this will
	cause the whole free list to be scanned and marked - boom!

	* gc.c (allocated_mark, MARK, heap_segment,
	scm_gc_mark_cell_conservatively, scm_init_storage), gc.h
	(scm_gc_mark_cell_conservatively):  Remove function
	scm_gc_mark_cell_conservatively and update the corresponding
	comments and uses accordingly.  Thanks to Christopher Cramer for
	the patch.  (Minor corrections by me.)

2001-09-15  Gary Houston  <ghouston@arglist.com>

	* root.h (scm_root_state): removed the continuation_stack and
	continuation_stack_ptr members, which have no apparent purpose.
	(scm_continuation_stack, scm_continuation_stack_ptr): #defines
	removed.

	* root.c (root_mark), init.c (restart_stack, start_stack), gc
	(scm_igc): remove all references to contination_stack and
	continuation_stack_ptr, avoiding allocation of a vector and
	useless processing during gc.

2001-09-13  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* guardians.c (tconc_t, t_tconc):  Renamed tconc_t to t_tconc.

	(TCONC_IN):  Make sure that the cell word 0 is initialized last.

	(guardians_t, t_guardians):  Renamed guardians_t to t_guardians.

	(GUARDIAN, GUARDIAN_DATA):  Renamed GUARDIAN to GUARDIAN_DATA.

	(guardian_apply, scm_get_one_zombie, scm_make_guardian,
	mark_and_zombify):  Prefer !SCM_<foo> over SCM_N<foo>.

2001-09-13  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* guardians.c (mark_dependencies_in_tconc,
	whine_about_self_centered_zombies, scm_init_guardians):  Register
	the static global variable `self_centered_zombies' via
	scm_gc_register_root, to make some cdr-ing unnecessary.

2001-09-13  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* backtrace.c (display_backtrace_file,
	display_backtrace_file_and_line):  Use SCM_EQ_P when comparing SCM
	values, use SCM_FALSEP when comparing SCM values against #f.
	Thanks to Rob Browning for the bug report.

2001-09-12  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* strings.[ch] (scm_str2string): New function.

2001-09-06  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* gc.c (scm_done_free): Always subtract size from scm_mallocated
	when computing nm, even if it's negative.
	(scm_must_malloc): Abort on overflow of scm_mtrigger.
	(scm_must_realloc): Likewise.

2001-09-01  Michael Livshin  <mlivshin@bigfoot.com>

	* numbers.c (scm_sys_check_number_conversions): new function,
	defined if Guile is compiled in debugging mode.  currently checks
	`scm_num2ulong', should check much much more.

	* num2integral.i.c (NUM2INTEGRAL): when converting a bignum to
	unsigned, ensure that it's positive.  thanks to Martin Baulig!

2001-08-31  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* __scm.h: Added new section about compile time selectable
	features.

	(long_long, ulong_long, scm_sizet, SCM_WNA, SCM_OUTOFRANGE,
	SCM_NALLOC, SCM_HUP_SIGNAL, SCM_INT_SIGNAL, SCM_FPE_SIGNAL,
	SCM_BUS_SIGNAL, SCM_SEGV_SIGNAL, SCM_ALRM_SIGNAL, SCM_GC_SIGNAL,
	SCM_TICK_SIGNAL, SCM_SIG_ORD, SCM_ORD_SIG, SCM_NUM_SIGS):
	Removed.

	* deprecation.c (scm_include_deprecated_features): Simplified.

	* eval.c (EVALCAR, unmemocopy), eval.h (SCM_XEVALCAR): Use
	`SCM_IMP' instead of `!SCM_CELLP´.

	* eval.c (unmemocopy): Eliminate redundant SCM_CELLP tests.
	Extract side-effecting operations from macros.

	(scm_init_eval): Don't initialize *top-level-lookup-closure*,
	scm_top_level_lookup_closure_var and scm_system_transformer.

	* gc.c (CELL_P): New local definition to replace SCM_CELLP.

	(heap_segment):  Use CELL_P instead of SCM_CELLP.

	* init.c (start_stack): Don't initialize
	scm_top_level_lookup_closure_var and scm_system_transformer.

	* modules.c (scm_set_current_module): Don't access
	scm_top_level_lookup_closure_var and scm_system_transformer.

	(scm_sym2var): Don't call scm_variable_set_name_hint.

	(scm_post_boot_init_modules): Removed deprecated initializations.

	* print.c (scm_ipruk): Don't access cell contents of non cells.

	* strings.c (scm_string_set_x):  All strings are writable.

	* strings.h (SCM_STRINGP):  Use SCM_TYP7 to determine the string
	type.  There is only one string type now.

	(SCM_STRING_COERCE_0TERMINATION_X): Deprecated.

	* tags.h: Remove comments about two different string types.

	(SCM_CELLP, SCM_NCELLP): Deprecated.

	* variable.c (make_variable): Remove code variant for vcells.

	* variable.h (SCM_VARIABLE_REF, SCM_VARIABLE_SET,

2001-07-01  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* strports.c (scm_read_0str, scm_eval_0str): Call
	scm_c_read_string and scm_c_eval_string respectively, not
	themselves.  Thanks to Dale P. Smith!

2001-06-30  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* unif.c (scm_array_set_x):  The variable args does not
	necessarily have to be a list.  Further, got rid of a redundant
	SCM_NIMP test.

2001-06-30  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* list.c (SCM_I_CONS):  Make sure the cell type is initialized
	last.

	* gc.c (s_scm_map_free_list, scm_igc, scm_gc_sweep,

	* weaks.h (WEAKSH, SCM_WEAKS_H):  Rename <foo>H to SCM_<foo>_H.

	(SCM_WVECTP):  Prefer !SCM_<pred> over SCM_N<pred>.

	The following patch adds conservative marking for the elements of

	conservatively.

	(scm_mark_locations, scm_cellp):  Extracted the search for the
	heap segment of a SCM value into function heap_segment.

	(scm_init_storage):  Allocated cells must be marked
	conservatively.

	* gc.[ch] (scm_gc_mark_cell_conservatively):  New function.

	The following patch changes the representation of weak vectors to
	double cells instead of using an extension of the vector's
	allocated memory.

	* gc.c (MARK):  Use SCM_SET_WVECT_GC_CHAIN instead of assigning to
	the result of SCM_WVECT_GC_CHAIN.

	(scm_gc_sweep):  Weak vectors don't have extra fields any more.

	* weaks.c (allocate_weak_vector):  New static function.  It does
	not patch any previously created vector object during the
	construction of a weak vector, and thus doesn't need to switch
	off interrupts during vector creation.

	(scm_make_weak_vector, scm_make_weak_key_hash_table,
	scm_make_weak_value_hash_table, scm_make_doubly_weak_hash_table):

	Use SCM_WVECT_TYPE.

	(SCM_WVECT_GC_CHAIN):  The weak objects are now chained together
	using an entry of the double cell.

	* load.c, load.h (scm_c_primitive_load,
	scm_c_primitive_load_path): New.

	* strports.c, strports.h (scm_c_read_string): Renamed from

	(scm_c_eval_string): Renamed from scm_eval_0str.
	(scm_read_0str, scm_eval_0str): Deprecated.

2001-06-28  Martin Grabmueller  <mgrabmue@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* read.c (scm_lreadr): When reading a hash token, check for a
	user-defined hash procedure first, so that overriding the builtin
	hash characters is possible (this was needed for implementing
	SRFI-4's read synax `f32(...)').

	* num2integral.i.c: Use scm_t_signed_bits instead of scm_t_bits,
	because the latter is unsigned now and breaks comparisons like
	(n < (scm_t_signed_bits)MIN_VALUE).

2001-06-26  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	* eval.h, eval.c (scm_call_4): New function.

	* eval.c (SCM_APPLY, SCM_CEVAL, ENTER_APPLY): Call trap handlers
	directly rather than dispatching to them via scm_ithrow and a lazy
	catch.

	not be affected at all.

	Thanks to Stefan Jahn for all necessary information, patches and

	* random.c: Define M_PI, if not predefined and use __int64 for
	LONG64 under Windows.

	* scmsigs.c: Emulate some functions (alarm, sleep, kill) under
	Windows and conditionalize some signal names.

	--disable-deprecated.

2001-05-24  Michael Livshin  <mlivshin@bigfoot.com>

	The purpose of this set of changes is to regularize Guile's usage
	of ANSI C integral types, with the following ideas in mind:

	- SCM does not nesessarily have to be long.
	- long is not nesessarily enough to store pointers.
	- long is not nesessarily the same size as int.

	The changes are incomplete and possibly buggy.  Please test on
	something exotic.

2001-04-01  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* gc.c (MARK):  Re-introduce a cheap sanity test for non debug
	mode, as suggested by Michael Livshin.

2001-03-31  Michael Livshin  <mlivshin@bigfoot.com>

	* backtrace.c (display_backtrace_body): since the `print_state'
	variable is not used (instead its data field is used directly as
	`pstate'), protect it from the hungry compiler optimizations.
	thanks to Bill Schottstaedt for the report.

2001-03-30  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* gc.[ch] (scm_tc16_allocated):  New type tag for allocated cells.
	It is only defined and used if guile is compiled with
	SCM_DEBUG_CELL_ACCESSES set to true.  It's purpose is, to never
	let cells with a free_cell type tag be visible outside of the
	garbage collector when in debug mode.

	* gc.c (scm_debug_cell_accesses_p):  Set to true as default.

	(scm_assert_cell_valid):  Use a local static variable to avoid
	recursion.

	(MARK):  Only check for rogue cell pointers in debug mode.  Use
	scm_cellp for this purpose and place all checks for rogue pointers
	into that function.  Further, since due to conservative scanning
	we may encounter free cells during marking, don't use the standard
	cell type accessor macro to determine the cell type.

	(scm_cellp):  Check if the cell pointer actually points into a
	card header.

	(scm_init_gc):  Initalize scm_tc16_allocated.

	* gc.h (GCH):  Renamed to SCM_GC_H.

	(SCM_VALIDATE_CELL):  Enclose the expression in brackets.  This
	might be unnecessary, but I feel better this way :-)

	(SCM_GC_CELL_TYPE):  New macro.

	(SCM_SETAND_CDR, SCM_SETOR_CDR):  Deprecated.  These are not used
	in guile, and it is unlikely that they will be applied to real
	pairs anyway.

	(SCM_SET_FREE_CELL_TYPE):  Removed.  It was not used.

	(SCM_GC_SET_ALLOCATED):  New macro.  Only non-empty if guile is
	compiled with SCM_DEBUG_CELL_ACCESSES set to true.

	(SCM_NEWCELL, SCM_NEWCELL2):  Use of SCM_GC_SET_ALLOCATED will
	make sure that in debug mode no free cell will ever be visible
	outside of the garbage collector.

2001-03-30  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* async.c (scm_asyncs_pending):  Don't use != to compare SCM

	avoid leakage.  use malloc, not scm_must_malloc.
	(scm_connect, scm_bind, scm_sendto): use int, not size_t as socklen_t
	substitute.  free the sockaddr structure before throwing an error.
	(scm_init_add_buffer): procedure removed, together with its static
	buffer scm_addr_buffer, which wouldn't be thread safe.  instead,
	define a macro MAX_ADDR_SIZE and declare the buffer where needed.
	(scm_accept, scm_getpeername, scm_getsockname, scm_recvfrom,
	scm_sendto): use a local buffer instead of scm_addr_buffer.
	adjust for new SCM_SOCK_FD_TO_PORT.  use int for address size,
	not size_t.
	(scm_recvfrom): set addr->sa_family to AF_UNSPEC before the recvfrom
	call to detect whether recvfrom could be bothered to set the address.
	(scm_init_socket): don't call scm_init_addr_buffer.

	and C names.
	(scm_select_module, scm_set_current_module): Likewise.  Changed
	all uses.

	* ports.c (scm_port_for_each): Make a snapshot of the port table
	before iterating over it.  The table might change while the user
	code is running.  With the snapshot, the user can depend on the
	fact that each port that existed at the start of the iteration is
	encountered exactly once.  (ice-9 popen) depends on this.

2001-02-08  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* strings.h (SCM_STRING_MAX_LENGTH):  New macro.

	* strings.c (scm_makstr, scm_take_str, scm_make_string):  Added

2001-01-26  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	The following patch was sent by Martin Grabmueller.  It makes sure

	shown, and that parameter types are only checked once.

	* strop.c (string_copy, string_upcase_x, string_downcase_x,
	string_capitalize_x):  New functions.  Each one performs the core
	functionality of the corresponding scm_* function.

	(scm_guard): depending on the value of `throw_p', return a boolean
 	result.
	(scm_get_one_zombie): remove redundant property test.
	(guardian_t): represent the various (currently 3, I hope nothing
 	more gets added) boolean fields as bit flags.
	(scm_guardian_destroyed_p, scm_guardian_greedy_p): new predicates.
	(scm_destroy_guardian_x): new procedure.

	* guardians.h: added prototypes for `scm_guardian_greedy_p' and

2001-01-01  Gary Houston  <ghouston@arglist.com>

	* fports.c (fport_write): bugfix: handle short writes for
