	scm_cur_loadp.

	* init.c (scm_init_standard_ports): Initialize scm_def_loadp.

	* ports.c (current-load-port): New procedure.

1998-06-09  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	to Julian Satchell and Roland Kaufmann.)

	* gh.h (gh_memv, gh_member): Fixed typos in macro definitions.

1998-06-07  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@barbara.nada.kth.se>

	* debug.h, debug.c (scm_start_stack): New function.  Implements
	the guts of old scm_m_start_stack.

	* debug.c (scm_m_start_stack): Use scm_start_stack.

	* init.c (scm_start_stack, scm_restart_stack): Renamed to
	start_stack and restart_stack.  (These have static scope.)

1998-05-19  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* readline.c (rl_cleanup_after_signals, rl_free_line_state): New
	readline functions to come in release 2.3.  (Thanks to Chet
	Ramey.)
	(handle_errors): Use the above functions.

1998-05-12  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* readline.c: Improvements for readline support: Handle errors
	better; Implement before-read-hook.

1998-05-11  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* init.c (scm_boot_guile_1), readline.c: Test for
	HAVE_RL_GETC_FUNCTION instead of HAVE_LIBREADLINE.  (Need to
	assure that we have version >= 2.1.)

1998-05-11  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@kenneth>

	* readline.c (scm_add_history): Bugfix: Do strdup before giving
	away the string to add_history.
	(completion_function): Do completion for readline. (Thanks to
	Andrew Archibald.)
	(scm_filename_completion_function): New procedure: Filename
	completer.

1998-05-09  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@kenneth>

	* scmsigs.c (scm_usleep): Bugfix: Don't define j if it isn't
	used.

1998-05-03  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* procprop.c (scm_i_procedure_arity): New function.  Returns arity
	of procedure.
	(scm_procedure_properties): Modified to return arity together with
	other properties.
	(scm_procedure_property): Added the read-only property `arity'.
	(scm_set_procedure_property_x): It is an error to set the `arity'
	property.

	* gsubr.h, gsubr.c: Moved macros from gsubr.c to gsubr.h and added
	prefix SCM_; Made f_gsubr_apply global and added prefix scm_.

	* procprop.h (scm_sym_arity): New symbol.

	to set the dispatch procedure of an operator or entity object.

	* objects.h (SCM_METACLASS_OPERATOR_LAYOUT, SCM_ENTITY_LAYOUT):
	Made procedure slots read-only.

	* eval.c (SCM_CEVAL): Moved scm_tc7_contin case above
	scm_tcs_cons_gloc case in zero args switch; Fixed args
	construction for operators in scm_tcs_cons_gloc case in two args
	switch.

1998-05-02  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* fluids.c: Removed use of assert.h (in order to avoid
	__eprintf).

	* Makefile.am (libguile_la_LDFLAGS): Added -export-dynamic.

	* dynl.c (maybe_drag_in_eprintf): Disabled through #ifdef 0.

	* eval.c (SCM_CEVAL): Do more thorough argument checking.  This
	change makes the evaluator safer at the cost of evaluation speed.
	It handles the case when the user has added a non-immediate
	improper end of the application form, e.g., `(+ 0 . x)'.
	(Earlier only cases like `(+ 0 . 0)' were handled.)  I've tried to
	minimize the extra cost as much as possible.  The new code is
	enclosed in #ifdef CAUTIOUS regions.  NOTE: This also fixes the
	problem with structs planted directly in the code (e.g. by a
	macro).  This no longer causes segmentation fault.  (Thanks to
	Eric Hanchrow.)
	
	* eval.c, eval.h (scm_eval_args, scm_deval_args): Take one extra
	arg `proc' in order to be able to throw errors; New argument
	checking code.

	* Removed extra #include "debug.h"

1998-04-25  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@kenneth>

	* scmsigs.c: Declare usleep as returning void on some systems.
	(scm_usleep): Return SCM_INUM0 on those systems. (Thanks to Julian
	Satchell.)

	* coop.c (usleep): Return void on some systems.

1998-04-20  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* Makefile.am (libguile_la_LDFLAGS): Removed redundant -rpath.

	* coop.c: Changed return type of usleep to int.

	* scmsigs.c (scm_usleep): New procedure; Declare usleep if it
	isn't found in the OS.

	* iselect.h: #define scm_internal_select select if GUILE_ISELECT
	isn't enabled.  (Thought that I had made this change ages ago...)

	* iselect.c: Declare bzero if not defined by OS.

1998-04-19  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* dynl.c (scm_must_free_argv): Fixed memory leak due to negated
	condition.  (Thanks to John Tobey.)

	* continuations.c (scm_make_cont), debug.c (scm_make_memoized,
	scm_make_debugobj), eval.c (scm_makprom): SCM_DEFER/ALLOW_INTS -->
	A section.

	* __scm.h: Start the long-term project of moving to POSIX threads.
	Phase 1: Classification of all critical sections.
	(SCM_ENTER_A_SECTION, SCM_EXIT_A_SECTION): New macros: Delimiters
	for A sections.  (See comments in __scm.h for details.)

	* dynl.c: Only check that HAVE_DLOPEN is defined before loading
	dynl-dl.c; Test on HAVE_LIBDLD instead of HAVE_DLD.

1998-04-18  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* Makefile.am (BUILT_SOURCES): Added cpp_err_symbols.c,
	cpp_sig_symbols.c, libpath.h and versiondat.h to BUILT_SOURCES
	(libpath.h, versiondat.h): Replaced dependency on Makefile with
	dependencies on $(srcdir)/Makefile.in
	$(top_builddir)/config.status in order to avoid circularity.

	* script.c (scm_compile_shell_switches): Bugfix: Don't discount i
	from argc if argc was 0 initially.

	* Makefile.am (Makefile.am): Replaced THREAD_LIBS --> GUILE_LIBS
	in generation of libpath.h.

1998-04-15  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@nada.kth.se>

	* Makefile.am (libguile_la_LDFLAGS): Bumped version number of
	libguile from 2 to 3.

1998-04-14  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@nada.kth.se>

	* Makefile.am: Added .x-dependencies to variable BUILT_SOURCES.

1998-04-13  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@kenneth>

	* ports.c (scm_port_line, scm_set_port_line_x, scm_port_column,
	scm_set_port_column_x, scm_port_filename,
	scm_set_port_filename_x): Removed optional arguments.  Added
	proper argument checking.

	* eval.c, eval.h, coop.c (scm_eval_stack, SCM_EVAL_STACK): Measure
	stack size in machine words.

	* unif.c (scm_uniform_vector_ref, scm_cvref, scm_array_set_x,
	rapr1): Use SCM_UCHARS instead of SCM_CHARS for strings.  (Thanks
	to Ole Myren Röhne.)

1998-04-12  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@kenneth>

	* socket.c: Check for HAVE_UNIX_DOMAIN_SOCKETS instead of
	UNIX_DOMAIN_SOCKETS.  (Thanks to Lauri Alanko.)

	* gc.c (scm_gc_sweep): Count cells correctly.  (Thanks to Ben
	Caradoc-Davies.)

	* eval.c (SCM_CEVAL, SCM_APPLY): In SCM_IM_APPLY and in the
	procedure apply: Copy argument lists before pushing them unto the
	environment so that the environment won't get mutated due to
	manipulation of procedure arguments.  This should perhaps be
	regarded as a temporary solution until someone finds a more
	efficient one.  (Thanks to Maciej Stachowiak.)

1998-04-10  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@kenneth>

	* script.c (scm_compile_shell_switches): Use "guile" as default
	zero arg if argc is NULL.

1998-04-02  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@nada.kth.se>

	* script.c (scm_compile_shell_switches): Allow NULL argv if argc
	is zero.  (Thanks to Dirk Herrmann.)

1998-03-30  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@nada.kth.se>

	* ports.c (scm_add_to_port_table): First line is now line 0
	(was 1).  (Interface changed according to suggestion by Per
	Bothner.)

	* backtrace.c (display_header): Add 1 to line and column numbers
	when presenting them to the user.

	* eval.h, eval.c, debug.h, debug.c (scm_evaluator_traps): Moved
	from debug.c --> eval.c

	* eval.h, eval.c (scm_eval_options_interface): New options
	interface.
	(SCM_EVAL_STACK): New option: Size of newly created stacks,
	i.e. stacks for new threads.
	
	* coop.c (COOP_STKSIZE): Use SCM_EVAL_STACK.

	* eval.c (unsafe_setjmp): Removed with #if 0.

	* gsubr.c (scm_gsubr_apply): Added dummy return to avoid compiler
	warning.

	* eval.c, numbers.c, unif.c, srcprop.c: Added a few curly braces
	to avoid compiler warnings.

	* dynl-dl.c (sysdep_dynl_func): Only define usymb if needed.

1998-03-28  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@nada.kth.se>

	* throw.c (handler_message): Print message on current error port
	instead of default error port.  (Thanks to Maciej Stachowiak.)

Mon Mar  2 21:35:02 1998  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* ports.c (scm_add_to_port_table): allocate in units of 
	struct scm_port_table *, not struct scm_port_table.
	* posix.c (scm_close_pipe): remove the port from the port table
	and mark as closed.
	Thanks to Rob Engle for both fixes.

1998-02-06  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* iselect.h, iselect.c, coop.c, coop-threads.c, coop-threads.h,
	coop-defs.h, throw.c, backtrace.c: Added new copyright year 1998.

1998-02-02  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* throw.h: Removed jmpbuf arg in scm_catch_body_t.

	* backtrace.c (display_error_body, display_backtrace_body),
	coop-threads.c (scheme_body_bootstrip, c_body_bootstrip),
	gh_eval.c (eval_str_wrapper, eval_file_wrapper), init.c
	(invoke_main_func), root.c (cwdr_body), throw.c (cwss_body,
	scm_body_thunk, hbpca_body): Removed the second jmpbuf arg on body
	functions.

	* throw.c (scm_internal_catch, scm_internal_lazy_catch): Bodies
	don't receive the jmpbuf arg anylonger.
	(scm_catch): Don't accept a #f tag.
	(scm_throw): Check that key is a symbol.
	(scm_ithrow): Don't take a jmpbuf as key.  Don't check key arg.

Fri Jan 30 22:28:07 1998  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@kenneth>

	* async.c (async_pending): Removed declaration.

1998-01-30  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	*  dynwind.c (scm_wind_chain): New debug function.

	* coop-threads.c (scheme_launch_data, scheme_body_bootstrip,
	scheme_handler_bootstrip, scheme_launch_thread, c_launch_data,
	c_body_bootstrip, c_handler_bootstrip, c_launch_thread): Add an
	extra layer of functions around the body and handler of a thread.
	This extra layer makes sure that the handler is called in the
	dynamic context of the surround (= empty dynwind list), but under
	the *dynamic root* of the body.  We can not use the dynamic root
	of the surround since that root belongs to another thread => stack
	is not handled correctly.  It may seem ugly to use this extra
	layer, but the extra cost in terms of execution time is really
	negligible compared to the total amount of time required to create
	a thread, and it would reduce maintainability to duplicate the
	crucial and complicated steps performed by cwdr.

	* __scm.h (SCM_ASYNC_TICK): Removed thread switching code.
	(SCM_ALLOW_INTS): Added thread switching code before interrupts
	get re-enabled.  The important effect of this is that interrupts
	are blocked during thread switching so that thread data structures
	don't risk getting messed up by an unfortunate signal.
	(SCM_REDEFER_INTS, SCM_REALLOW_INTS): It turned out that gcc-2.8.0
	seems to do more aggressive optimization which actually move
	instructions around in these macros in a fatal way.  Therefore:
	Introduce Anthony's SCM_FENCE macro!  (And I who thought he was
	just superstitious...)
	(SCM_TICK): Maybe do a context switch and take care of asyncs.
	This macro should be used instead of SCM_ASYNC_TICK since the
	latter doesn't do context switches any more.

	* eval.c (scm_eval, scm_deval), eq.c (scm_equal_p): Use SCM_TICK
	instead of SCM_ASYNC_TICK.

	* coop.c, iselect.c: Since thread switches are now performed with
	interrupts masked, we can't use the old mechanism of delivering
	signals immediately when they arrive.  Signals must instead be
	delivered when the asyncs run *after* the end of the critical
	section in scm_internal_select.  But this also means after context
	switch so that the signal will be delivered to a different thread.
	To avoid this, I have changed the protocol of
	coop_wait_for_runnable_thread and friends so that they are allowed
	to return the original thread.  So, if a signal arrives during
	scm_internal_select, we won't any longer be forced do a context
	switch, but can remain in the same thread and deliver the signal
	to it.

	* async.c, async.h (asyncs_pending): Renamed asyncs_pending -->
	scm_asyncs_pending and made it global.

	* iselect.c: Small fixes.

	* coop.c (coop_mutex_init, coop_mutex_lock, coop_mutex_unlock,
	coop_condition_variable_init, coop_condition_variable_wait,
	coop_condition_variable_signal): Changed return type from `void'
	to `int'.  This is to adhere closer to the pthreads interface.
	This, in turn, is part of an attempt to provide C versions of the
	mutex and condition variable primitives which can be part of a
	frontend to COOP or pthreads.

	* coop.c (coop_mutex_destroy, coop_condition_variable_wait_mutex,
	coop_condition_variable_destroy): New functions.
	
	* coop-threads.c (scm_wait_condition_variable): Use
	coop_condition_variable_wait_mutex.

	* coop-threads.h, coop-defs.h (coop_q_t, coop_m, coop_c):
	Definitions moved to coop-defs.h.

	* coop-defs.h (scm_mutex_init, scm_mutex_lock, scm_mutex_unlock,
	scm_mutex_destroy, scm_cond_init, scm_cond_wait, scm_cond_signal,
	scm_cond_destroy): New C interface to mutecis and cond vars.

1998-01-24  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* error.c (scm_wta): Added support for SCM_ARG6 and SCM_ARG7.

	* iselect.c: Now several threads can wait on the same file
	descriptor.  The behaviour is compatible with OS select: All
	threads waiting for the fd return with the same status.

1998-01-23  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* coop-threads.c, threads.h (scm_spawn_thread): New function.
	Can spawn a thread from application C code.

1998-01-20  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* gh.h, gh_data.c (gh_doubles2scm, gh_doubles2dvect,
	gh_doubles2scm): New functions.

1998-01-15  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@nis.lanl.gov>

	* gh_eval.c (gh_eval_str): cleanup -- threw out the old
	commented-out version of gh_eval_str()

Sun Jan  4 02:23:36 1998  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* socket.c (scm_bind): free soka after use.

Sat Jan  3 20:55:07 1998  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* stime.c (tzvar): new variable.
	(setzone, restorezone, scm_localtime, scm_mktime, scm_strftime):
	avoid memory leaks when allocating.

1998-01-03  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.red-bean.com>

	* iselect.h: Some systems require <sys/types.h> to get the FD_SET
	macro definitions.

	* gc.c, tags.h: Doc fixes.

1998-01-02  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* eval.c (macro-eval!): Removed.  This function was a design bug.
	It allowed memoized code to leak out to the scheme level.  Most
	things that you could do with `macro-eval!' can be done with
	`local-eval'.

1997-12-20  Tim Pierce  <twp@skepsis.com>

	* fports.c (scm_pipob): Use scm_generic_fgets for line i/o, since
	scm_fgets now depends on ftell(3) to know how many bytes were
	read.  Sigh.

1997-12-15  Tim Pierce  <twp@skepsis.com>

	* gh_data.c (gh_scm2newstr, gh_get_substr): Use RO macros for
	dealing with strings.

1997-12-13  Tim Pierce  <twp@skepsis.com>

	Make %read-line more suitable for implementing read-line efficiently.
	* ioext.c (scm_read_line): Strip the terminating newline from a
	string, and return a cons of the string and its terminator.

	* fports.c, fports.h (scm_fgets): Add `len' argument.  The length
	of the string that is read is stored in this memory location.
	* ports.c, ports.h (scm_generic_fgets, fgets_void_port): Same.
	* genio.c, genio.h (scm_do_read_line): Update caller.
	* ports.h (scm_ptobfuns): Update typedef.
	* fports.c (scm_fptob, scm_pipob): Update struct.

1997-12-08  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* filesys.c (set_element): Return file descriptor.
	(fill_select_type): Return the highest file descriptor.
	(scm_select): Tell select about the highest file descriptor.  On
	some systems the SELECT_SET_SIZE can be as much as 128 bytes.
	Therefore the extra overhead for calculating the maximum fd seems
	to be more than compensated.  Is this correct?  In any case,
	scm_internal_select will be much faster with this info.
	(scm_select, fill_select_type, set_element): Don't accept any kind
	of object in the file descriptor list or vector.

1997-12-07  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* iselect.c (finalize_fd_sets): Bugfix.

1997-12-06  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* filesys.c (scm_select): Don't use SCM_DEFER_INTS/SCM_ALLOW_INTS
	when using scm_internal_select (since we might switch to another
	thread).

Sun Dec  7 01:43:56 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* simpos.c (scm_system): always define: use sysmissing if not
	available.  Check for HAVE_SYSTEM instead of _Windows (does
	Windows lack system or does it have an unusable one?).
	Check for error conditions -1 and 127.  Use SCM_DEFER_INTS.
	Let the argument be optional: if not supplied, call system(NULL).

	* ports.c (scm_close_port): relax the type check from OPPORTP to
	PORTP; closing a closed port is allowed.

1997-12-04  Tim Pierce  <twp@ppp39.Nantucket.net>

	* fports.c (scm_fgets): Return if the last char in a chunk is
	newline.  When fgets returns a string whose length is `size-1', it
	is ambiguous whether a whole line was retrieved, so we must check
	explicitly whether a line terminator is present.

1997-12-04  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* print.h (SCM_COERCE_OUTPORT): Check that the object is a pair
	before taking the CDR. (Thanks to Harald Meland.)

	* filesys.c (scm_stat): Slightly optimized.

Wed Dec  3 12:23:06 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.red-bean.com>

	* ports.c (scm_close_port): Make sure the port is open before
	trying to close it.

	* guile-snarf.in: Pass args through to gcc in a way that preserves
	whitespace boundaries.  (Thanks to Greg Badros.)

1997-12-02  Tim Pierce  <twp@skepsis.com>

	* stacks.c (scm_frame_procedure): Reverse the logic in the return
	statement.  (Thanks to Doug Evans for pointing this out.)

1997-12-01  Tim Pierce  <twp@skepsis.com>

	* scmconfig.h.in: Regenerated for USCORE change in ../acconfig.h.

Sun Nov 30 11:29:18 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@kenneth>

	* coop-defs.h (struct coop_t): Renamed errno --> _errno to prevent
	errno macro expansion of this field name.  (errno is a C
	preprocessor macro on some systems.)

1997-11-29  Tim Pierce  <twp@skepsis.com>

	* iselect.c: Doc fix.

Sat Nov 29 01:16:53 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@kenneth>

	* init.c (scm_start_stack): Removed initialization of
	scm_the_last_stack_var.

	* backtrace.h: Declare scm_the_last_stack_var.

	* backtrace.c: Define scm_the_last_stack_var.

	* root.c (mark_root): Don't mark the_last_stack_var.

	* root.h (scm_root_state): Removed the_last_stack_var.

	* throw.c: Added #include "fluids.h"
	(ss_handler): `the-last-stack' is now a fluid.

	* (backtrace.h, backtrace.c, throw.c): Renamed the_last_stack_var
	--> the_last_stack_fluid.
	
	* backtrace.c: Added #include "fluids.h"
	(scm_init_backtrace): Initialize `the-last-stack' to a fluid.
	(scm_backtrace): `the-last-stack' is now a fluid.

	* init.c (scm_boot_guile_1): Moved call to scm_init_backtrace
	after scm_init_fluids.

1997-11-28  Tim Pierce  <twp@skepsis.com>

	* iselect.c: #ifdef USE_THREADS around thread-related includes.

	* dynl-dl.c (sysdep_dynl_func): Check both USCORE and
	DLSYM_ADDS_USCORE to decide whether to add an underscore.

1997-11-28  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* iselect.c (coop_next_runnable_thread,
	coop_wait_for_runnable_thread): Disable interrupts so that no
	async is executed before a potential error_revive.
	(scm_internal_select): Disable interrupts during the parts of the
	code which manipulate the sleep queue and the file descriptors.

1997-11-27  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* Makefile.am: Added iselect.c and iselect.h.

	* coop.c (coop_qinit): Initialize fields used by
	scm_internal_select.
	(coop_qget, coop_qget, coop_tmp_queue): Made global.
	(coop_next_runnable_thread): If GUILE_ISELECT enabled, use
	replacement in iselect.c.
	(coop_mutex_lock, coop_condition_variable_wait, coop_abort,
	coop_join): If GUILE_ISELECT enabled, use
	coop_wait_for_runnable_thread instead of
	coop_next_runnable_thread.
	(usleep, sleep): New replacements for system functions if
	GUILE_ISELECT is enabled.

	* coop-threads.h: Declare coop_wait_for_runnable_thread.

	* coop-defs.h (coop_t): Added fields used by scm_internal_select.

	* filesys.c: Added #include "iselect.h".  Moved FD-macros to
	iselect.h.  Implement Scheme level `select' using
	scm_internal_select.  (See NEWS.)

	* genio.c (scm_getc): Block with scm_internal_select.  (See NEWS.)

	* init.c: Call scm_init_iselect.

	* iselect.h, iselect.c: New files.  Implements
	scm_internal_select.  (See NEWS.)

1997-11-27  Tim Pierce  <twp@skepsis.com>

	Fix a memory leak in scm_read_line and a type cast bug in the ptob.
	* fports.c (scm_fgets): Use malloc/free rather than scm_must_malloc
 	and scm_must_free, since ultimately the	string returned will be copied
 	by scm_makfrom0str anyway.  Also, read any characters that may have
	been pushed onto the port with scm_ungetc.
	* ports.c (scm_generic_fgets): Same as for scm_fgets.
	* ioext.c (scm_read_line): Free string after Guilifying it.
	* ports.h (scm_ptobfuns): fgets method returns a char *, not a char.

	* gh.h: Safely wrap prototypes for c++ usage.

1997-11-25  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* gh_test_repl.c (main_prog): changed invocation of gh_repl() to
	gh_repl (argc, argv).

1997-11-24  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@nis.lanl.gov>

	* gh_init.c (gh_repl): modified gh_repl() to accept argc and argv
	and to invoke scm_shell().
	(gh_launch_pad): took out the loading of boot-9.scm from here,
	since it is probably best to let the user control that.  In fact,
	gh_repl() now invokes scm_shell() which does that.

1997-11-23  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* gh_test_repl.c (main_prog): added argc and argv to the gh_repl()
	invocation.

1997-11-22  Tim Pierce  <twp@twp.tezcat.com>

	* dynl-dl.c (sysdep_dynl_func): Prepend symb with underscore if
	DLSYM_ADDS_USCORE is not defined.

	* regex-posix.c (scm_free_regex_t): Return size of regex_t instead
	of 0; size_t --> scm_size_t.  Thanks to Bernard Urban.

1997-10-26  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@nada.kth.se>

	* scmconfig.h.in: Updated (HAVE_LIBTERMCAP was added when
	configure.in was changed).

1997-10-25  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* print.h (SCM_COERCE_OPORT): Renamed to SCM_COERCE_OUTPORT.  An
	OPORT is an `open' port, not an output port.

	scm_set_port_filename_x, scm_port_mode,
	scm_close_all_ports_except, scm_set_current_output_port,
	scm_set_current_error_port): Likewise
	* ioext.c (scm_redirect_port, scm_dup_to_fdes, scm_freopen,
	scm_ftell, scm_fileno, scm_isatty_p, scm_primitive_move_to_fdes):
	Likewise
	* posix.c (scm_ttyname, scm_tcgetpgrp, scm_tcsetpgrp): Likewise
	* backtrace.c (display_backtrace_body): Likewise
	* fports (scm_setvbuf): Likewise
	* socket.c (scm_getsockopt, scm_setsockopt, scm_shutdown,
	scm_connect, scm_bind, scm_listen, scm_accept, scm_getsockname,
	scm_getpeername, scm_send, scm_sendto): Likewise
	* unif.c (scm_uniform_array_write): Likewise

	exactly what we want to leave in to detect substrings.
	(SCM_ROSTRINGP, ROUCHARS): Formatting tweaks.
	* tags.h: Fix diagrams and comments describing the S tag bit;
	remove vestigial remarks about the D tag bit.
	(SCM_TYP7, SCM_TYP7S): Rephrased for readability.
	* strings.c: Formatting tweaks.

	* load.c (scm_init_load_path): Check GUILE_LOAD_PATH environment
	variable first; then SCHEME_LOAD_PATH, with a warning message.
	(scm_parse_path): New function.
	* script.c: Doc fixes.

Thu Oct 23 01:02:03 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.red-bean.com>

	Readline support, from Daniel Risacher.
	* readline.c, readline.h: New files.
	* init.c: #include "readline.h".
	(scm_boot_guile_1): Call scm_init_readline, if we have it.
	* Makefile.am (libguile_la_SOURCES): Include readline.c.
	* Makefile.in: Regenerated.
	* scmconfig.h.in: Regenerated, after change to ../configure.

1997-10-20  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@nis.lanl.gov>

	* gh.h: gh_vector_set -> gh_vector_set_x

1997-10-20  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@nis.lanl.gov>

	* gh_data.c (gh_vector_set_x): changed name to make it consistent
	with the ! -> _x mapping when going from Scheme to C.

	* gh.h (gh_reverse): 
	(gh_list_tail):

	(gh_assq): 
	(gh_assv): 
	(gh_assoc): added these gh_ functions implemented as macros.

	* gh_predicates.c (gh_null_p): 
	(gh_string_equal_p): added these two missing predicates.

	* gh_list.c (gh_append): 
	(gh_append2): 
	(gh_append3): 
	(gh_append4): 
	(gh_set_car_x): 
	(gh_set_cdr_x): added these routines as I go through and try to
	complete the picture R4RS functions that should be mirrored in the
	gh_ interface.

Sat Oct 18 01:52:51 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* tags.h (scm_tc7_substring): Changed the comment and code to
	conform with the changes below.  Folks!  We have suddenly two new
	free tc7 codes!!!  Jummy, jummy!

Tue Oct 14 22:03:06 1997  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

	(SCM_TYP7D): Removed.
	(scm_tc7_mb_string): Removed.
	(scm_tc7_mb_substring): Removed.

	handle mbstrings.
	Don't include "mbstrings.h".
	* symbols.c (scm_intern_obarray_soft, scm_string_to_symbol,
	scm_string_to_obarray_symbol, msymbolize): Don't set symbol's

	representation.
	* ports.h (scm_port_representation_type): Removed.
	(scm_string_representation_type): Removed.
	(struct scm_port_table ): Removed representation field.
	(SCM_PORT_REPRESENTATION): Removed.

1997-10-12  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* gh_test_repl.c (c_vector_test): same as gh_test_c.c

	* gh_test_c.c (c_vector_test): some improvements on the vector
	routines test.

	* gh.h (gh_vector): this used to exist but do the wrong thing.
	Now it (almost) does the right thing, though it takes a list
	instead of the individual arguments.  I need to see how it could
	be done right.
	(gh_list_to_vector): added this function as a macro.  Corresponds
	to Scheme's (list->vector ...).
	(gh_vector_to_list): added this function as a macro.  Corresponds
	to Scheme's (vector->list ...).

	* gh_data.c (gh_vector_ref): renamed from gh_vref to
	gh_vector_ref, so that it resembles the Scheme routines more.
	(gh_vector_set): renamed from gh_vset to gh_vector_set, so that it
	resembles the Scheme routines more.
	(gh_make_vector): this used to be (stupidly) called gh_vector().
	This is the right name, since it does the same thing as the Scheme
	(make-vector ...) procedure.

Sun Oct 12 14:41:39 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@kenneth>

	* ports.h: #include "libguile/print.h"

	* eval.c (SCM_CEVAL, scm_apply): Completed GOOPS support code;
 	Some indentation fixes.

	* objects.h (SCM_METACLASS_STANDARD_LAYOUT): Printer field is no
	longer a user field; New field: class_flags.

Tue Oct  7 09:37:24 1997  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* gh_data.c (gh_bool2scm): new function which replaces
	gh_int2scmb(), which is now tagged as obsolete.

1997-10-03  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@nada.kth.se>

	* print.h (SCM_PRINT_STATE_P): Removed SCM_NIMP test.  (NIMP
	macros should by convention not test for NIMPness.)
	(SCM_COERCE_OPORT): Adjust indentation.

	* print.c (scm_valid_oport_value_p): Adjusted indentation; Added
	SCM_NIMP test before SCM_PRINT_STATE_P.

	* struct.c, struct.h, gc.c: Renamed:
	scm_struct_i_layout	   --> scm_vtable_index_layout
	scm_struct_i_vcell	   --> scm_vtable_index_vcell
	scm_struct_i_vtable	   --> scm_vtable_index_vtable
	scm_struct_i_printer	   --> scm_vtable_index_printer
	scm_struct_i_vtable_offset --> scm_vtable_offset_user
	
	* struct.c (scm_print_struct): Use new printer slot; Default
	printing: Also output hex code of vtable so that type identity
	will be indicated as well.
	(scm_init_struct): Updated required_vtable_fields to "pruosrpw";
	Removed struct_printer_var; Removed struct-vtable-offset;
	(vtable-index-layout, vtable-index-vtable, vtable-index-printer,
	vtable-offset-user): New constants.

	* struct.h (scm_struct_i_vtable_offset): Bumped from 3 to 4.
	(scm_struct_i_printer, SCM_STRUCT_PRINTER): New slot in vtables.
  	If this slot contains a procedure, use that to print structures of
 	the type represented by this vtable.

	* print.c (scm_iprin1): Don't print arguments of macro
 	transformers.  (They are always: exp env.); Bugfix: Unmemoize
 	transformer source with correct environment.

1997-10-02  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	Streamlining of call-with-dynamic-root:
	
	* root.c (cwdr_inner_body, cwdr_body): Remove "inner" from name,
	there is now only one catch.
	(cwdr_outer_body): Removed.
	(cwdr_handler): New function.
	(scm_internal_cwdr): New function to perform the function of cwdr
	but take args that are more useful to C code.  Also, the handler
	is now invoked *outside* of the new dynamic root, like the docs
	say.  We no longer have to catch absolutely all errors, the caller
	is responsible for using a handler that does not throw, if he
	wants that.
	(cwdr): Reimplemented in terms of scm_internal_cwdr.
	* root.h (scm_internal_cwdr): New prototype.

	Even more but risky streamlining:
	
	* root.c (USE_STACKJMPBUF): New define to activate a stack-based
	allocation of the jumpbuf of a root continuation.  The changes
	below are controlled by it.  They are now deactivated.
	(scm_internal_cwdr): Allocate the scm_contregs on the stack.  Set
	the JMPBUF of the scm_rootcont to NULL before returning.

	* gc.c (scm_gc_sweep): Free the SCM_VELTS of a scm_tc7_contin only
	when they are non-NULL.
	(scm_gc_mark): Likewise, mark only when non-NULL.

	Make dynamic linking work on Dec Unix. (Thanks to Clark McGrew)
	* dynl.c: Include "dynl-dl.c" also when HAVE_DLOPEN is defined.

	* gc.c (scm_done_malloc): New function.
        gc.h (scm_done_malloc): New prototype.
	
	* print.h (SCM_PRINT_STATE_P, SCM_COERCE_OPORT): New macros.
	(struct scm_print_state) [revealed]: New field.
	(scm_print_state_vtable): Make visible to the outside world for
	type checking purposes.
	(scm_valid_oport_value_p): New prototype.
	
	* print.c (scm_valid_oport_value_p): New function to check whether
	a certain value is acceptable as a port argument.
	(scm_print_state_vtable): New variable.
	(scm_free_print_state): Set `revealed' field to false.
	(scm_iprin1): Call user supplied closure printer with
	scm_printer_apply.  Print in the traditional way when there isn't
	one or when it returns #f.
	(scm_prin1, scm_display, scm_write, scm_newline, scm_write_char):
	Accept a port/print-state pair in addition to just a port.
	(scm_prin1): Don't return the print_state to the pool when it has
	been `revealed'.
	(scm_printer_apply): Set `revealed' field of print_state to true.
	(scm_init_print): Set scm_print_state_vtable.
	(print_state_fluid, print_state_fluid_num): Removed.
	
	* throw.h (scm_handle_by_proc_catching_all): New prototype
	throw.c (scm_handle_by_proc_catching_all): New function
	
Mon Sep 29 23:54:09 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.red-bean.com>

	* Makefile.in: Regenerated with automake 1.2c.

Sun Sep 28 21:35:42 1997  Radey Shouman  <shouman@zianet.com>

	* ramap.c (scm_array_index_map_x): Fixed for zero-rank arguments,
	was looping endlessly.

Sun Sep 28 00:04:29 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.red-bean.com>

	* strports.c (scm_eval_string): Don't close the port.

	* stime.c (bdtime2c): Use SCM_LENGTH, not scm_vector_length; the
	former returns a nice normal integer.  (Thanks to Daniel
	Risacher.)

Sat Sep 27 20:19:34 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.red-bean.com>

	* Makefile.am (libpath.h): Include the value of the THREAD_LIBS
	makefile variable as a build parameter called LIBS.  The
	build-guile program will use this, for the time being.
	* Makefile.in: Regenerated.

	Thanks to Shiro Kawai:
	* gc.c (scm_gc_mark): Pass NULL to scm_wta as the subroutine name.
	* ports.h (scm_ptobfuns): The fgets method returns a char *, not
	an SCM.

	* Makefile.in: Regenerated with automake 1.2a.

	* script.c (scm_compile_shell_switches): If we hit the -c or --
	arguments, don't set the car of (command-line) to scm_usage_name,
	the prettified name of the guile executable; give it the full
	path, the way shells usually handle $0. 

Wed Sep 24 22:09:52 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* ramap.c (scm_array_map): Renamed to scm_array_map_x.  Removed
 	Scheme-level name `array-map' and renamed `serial-array-map' to
 	`serial-array-map!'.

	* backtrace.c: Introduced exception handlers which now enclose
	`display-error' and `display-backtrace' so that error reporting
	won't get into infinite loops if an error occurs during displaying
	of the error.  This can very easily happen with user supplied
	print call-back routines.

Tue Sep 23 12:43:17 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* ramap.c: Added alias `array-map!' for `array-map'.  (Probably,
	the names `serial-array-map' and `array-map' should be removed.)

Mon Sep 22 01:21:54 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@kenneth>

	* init.c (scm_boot_guile_1): Added scm_init_objects ().
	Added #include "objects.h"

	* eval.c (scm_makprom): Added SCM_DEFER_INTS and SCM_ALLOW_INTS.
	Add #include "feature.h".

	* Makefile.am (libguile_la_SOURCES): Added objects.c.
	(modinclude_HEADERS): Added objects.h.

	* ports.h (SCM_EOF_OBJECT_P): New macro predicate.
	This test is needed at many places in the code and should be
	abstracted.  (Motivated by the need of this test in libguiletk.)

	* ports.c (scm_eof_object_p), vports.c (sfgetc), strports.c
	(scm_eval_string), load.c (scm_primitive_load,
 	scm_read_and_eval_x), gh_eval.c (gh_eval_str):
	Use SCM_EOF_OBJECT_P.

	* eval.c (scm_init_eval): Add feature `delay'.

Tue Sep 16 02:12:02 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* scmhob.h: Removed.

Mon Sep 15 20:42:03 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* list.h (SCM_LISTn): New macros.  Make list creation in C code
 	prettier.  The idea comes from STk.

	* sequences.h, sequences.c, append.h, append.c: Removed.  These
 	files implemented non-R4RS operations which would encourage
 	non-portable programming style and less easy-to-read code.

	* Makefile.am (sequences.h, sequences.c, append.h, append.c):
 	Removed.
	
	* libguile.h, eval.c, init.c, stime.c, unif.c: Removed #include
 	sequences.h, #include append.h.

	* init.c (scm_boot_guile_1): Removed calls to scm_init_append and
	scm_init_sequences.

	* gh.h, gh_list.c: Renamed gh_list_length --> gh_length.

	* list.h, list.c: Renamed scm_list_length --> scm_length, scm

	* stime.c (bdtime2c): Changed scm_obj_length --> scm_vector_length.

Sat Sep 13 00:21:41 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* eval.c: Added #include "objects.h"

	* tags.h (scm_tc16_object, scm_tc16_entity): Smobtags for objects
 	and entities.

	* smob.c (scm_smob_prehistory): Create two objectsmobs with
 	adjacent smob numbers.

Thu Sep 11 00:59:17 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* procprop.h: Added declaration of scm_i_inner_name.

	* gsubr.c: New global symbol scm_i_inner_name.

	* debug.c (scm_procedure_name): Try procedure property
	`inner-name' if `name' fails.

	* print.c (scm_iprin1): Use scm_macro_name.

	* eval.c (scm_m_define): Give names to macros as well; Only the
 	first top-level definition gives a procedure/macro a name.
  	Otherwise confusing names can turn up in backtraces.
	(SCM_CEVAL): SCM_IM_DEFINE: Set `inner-name' property instead of
 	`name'; Give names to macros as well.

	* procs.c (scm_closure_p), print.c (scm_iprin1), eval.c
 	(scm_macro_transformer): Use SCM_CLOSUREP instead of
 	scm_closure_p.

Wed Sep 10 20:52:18 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

*	* eval.c (macro?, macro-type, macro-name, macro-transfomer): New
 	procedures;
	(prinmacro): Removed.  The code has been moved/merged into print.c
 	in order to decrease code redundancy.  We want macros to print in
 	a way equivalent to procedures, and it would be silly to duplicate
 	the required code.  (We don't want to maintain two places.)
	(macrosmob): Print field is now a NULL pointer.
	
	* eval.h (scm_macro_p, scm_macro_type, scm_macro_name,
 	scm_macro_transformer): New prototypes.
	(scm_tc16_macro): Declared.

	This is consistent with the R4RS append and is probably the
	correct behaviour as specified by R2RS.  (Thanks to Radey Shouman)

Sat Aug 16 18:42:15 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* stime.h: prototype for scm_times.
	* stime.c (scm_times): new procedure.

	* stacks.c (scm_make_stack), coop-threads.c, mit-pthreads.c
	(scm_call_with_new_thread): Bugfix: SCM_WNA should go as third
	argument to SCM_ASSERT.  Furthermore, the name of the function
	should be passed as first argument when signalling
	SCM_WNA. (Thanks to Thomas Morgan)

	* gsubr.c (scm_gsubr_apply): From Radey Shouman
	<shouman@zianet.com>: "The switch in scm_gsubr_apply that
	dispatches on the number of actual args has a default case
	reporting an internal error.  This is a vestige from a version
	that mallocated a SCM vector to hold the arguments.  In the
	current version this check is too late: if it ever happens we will
	have already overstepped the bounds of the array.

	Also, the patch [...] adds a check for too many actual arguments."

	mdj: Removed check for "internal programming error".

Wed Aug 13 15:38:44 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* ioext.h: removed scm_duplicate_port prototype.

	* ioext.c (scm_primitive_dup2): return the new file descriptor

	* dynl.c (scm_dynamic_link): Moved allocating of the memory for
 	the dynamic object data below the linking of the object to avoid
 	memory leak when the linking code throws an error.  Now the code
 	leaks a whole dynamically linked library when must_malloc throws,
 	but that should be much less likely.

Fri Jul 11 00:19:47 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.red-bean.com>

	* root.c: Establish a reliable catch-all handler for the new root.
	After all the Scheme handler function might signal an error too,
	and we don't want to lose that.

	(cwdr_outer_body): New function, to establish the user's handler,
	and pass control to cwdr_inner_body.
	(cwdr): Establish the reliable catch-all handler here, and pass

	* dynl.c (scm_dynamic_func): Cast return value from sysdep_dynl_func.
	* extchrs.c (xmbtowc): Make the second arg a normal char, not
	unsigned, because that's what the ANSI function takes.
	* extchrs.h (xmbtowc): Corresponding change to prototype.
	* genio.c (scm_gen_getc): Make buf plain chars.  Nobody wants
	uchars here.
	* mbstrings.c (scm_mb_ilength): Use ANSI arg syntax.  Make DATA

	* unif.c (scm_array_to_list): If we want to shift a 1 bit to the
	top of the word, it should be unsigned.

	* eval.c (scm_lookupcar1): Don't declare var2 unless USE_THREADS
	is defined, to avoid warnings; it's only used in the
	conflict-checking code.  Which might go away anyway.
	(SCM_CEVAL): All goto's targeting the `dispatch' label are in
	conditionals; put the label definition in an #if too, to stifle
	warnings.

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Include ChangeLog-gh and

Sat Jun 14 19:00:58 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* scmsigs.c (sys_deliver_signals): add a comment about a probable bug.

Wed Jun 11 00:33:00 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.red-bean.com>

	* Makefile.in: Regenerated after xtra_PLUGIN_guile_libs change in
	../configure.in.

Sun Jun  8 14:37:26 1997  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* eval.c (scm_lookupcar1): New procedure to cope with a race
 	condition during lookup (when using threads).
	(scm_lookupcar): Implement in terms of scm_lookupcar1.
	(SCM_CEVAL): Use scm_lookupcar1 instead of scm_lookupcar in one
 	place.

Fri Jun  6 19:05:07 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* regex-posix.c (scm_regexp_exec): Use the `start' argument if
	supplied.  (Change from Tim Pierce.) 

Thu Jun  5 16:38:19 1997  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* struct.c (init_struct): Forget to mention this in the "Wed Jun 4
 	23:47:01 1997" changelog: Slots are now initialized with `#f' by
 	default and not `()'.  `#f' is the canonical non-value in Scheme,
 	right?

Wed Jun  4 23:47:01 1997  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* struct.c (struct_printer): New variable that holds a handle on
 	the Scheme variable *struct-printer*.  This variable can be set by
 	Scheme code to override the printing of structures.
	(scm_print_struct): If struct_printer is set, call it.  If it is
	not set, or returns #f, print the structure in the old fashion.
	Include "eval.h" for scm_apply.
	
Tue Jun  3 23:01:39 1997  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* struct.c (scm_struct_ref, scm_struct_set_x): Use
 	scm_struct_i_n_words to get the number of fields, not
 	-scm_struct_n_extra_words.

	On the route to fancier struct printing:
	* struct.c (scm_print_struct): New function to print a structure.
  	Include "genio.h" to support it.  This function doesn't do
 	anything interesting right now, but I think it should be here
 	anyway.
	* struct.h: Include "print.h" and add prototype for
 	scm_print_struct.
	* print.c (scm_iprin1): Call scm_print_struct instead of trying to
 	print structures ourself.
	
Sun Jun  1 07:58:41 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* scmsigs.c (sys_deliver_signals): bug fix: reset got_signal[i]
	before applying the handler in case it doesn't return.

Sat May 31 18:57:51 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* scmsigs.h, async.h: updated.
	
	* _scm.h: if HAVE_RESTARTS is defined then don't use a SYSCALL
	loop.

	* posix.c (scm_uname): interpret only negative values as an error.
  	Solaris normally returns a positive value.

	* script.c (scm_compile_shell_switches): if we are not going into
	an interactive repl, set scm_mask_ints to zero so that asyncs can
	run.

	* simpos.c (scm_system):  don't ignore/unignore signals around
	the "system" call.

	* posix.c (scm_open_pipe): don't ignore/unignore signals around
	the "popen" call.

	* init.c (scm_boot_guile_1): don't call scm_init_signals, it's
	done in boot-9.scm instead.

	* scmsigs.c, async.c: Major rewriting of signal handling code.
	(scm_sigaction): new procedure.
 	(scm_sleep): don't wrap sleep in SCM_SYSCALL, it would mess up the
	timing.
	(scm_raise): return unspecified, throw error on failure.

Thu May 29 02:47:36 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* regex-posix.c (scm_init_regex_posix): Register the "regex"
	feature, to help boot-9.scm decide whether to import the regex
	module. 

Thu May 29 02:19:40 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* eval.c: Include scmconfig.h at the beginning of the file so that
 	HAVE_ALLOCA_H may properly be defined.  Thanks to Bill Janssen for
 	pointing this out.

	* regex-posix.c: #include "_scm.h" before conditionally #including
	<regex.h>; the former defines HAVE_REGCOMP.

	* regex-posix.c: #include <regex.h> conditionally, so the file is
	CPP'able (for dependency scanning) even on systems that don't have
	a <regex.h> header.

Tue May 27 23:48:38 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	Add new R4RS-compliant syntax for keywords.
	* read.c (scm_lreadr): Recognize `#:' as a prefix for keywords,
	regardless of the setting of the `keywords' read option.
	* kw.c (prin_kw): Print keywords using the `#:' syntax, so they
	can be re-read no matter what the setting of the `keywords' read
	option.

Tue May 27 22:47:31 1997  Tim Pierce  <twp@twp.tezcat.com>

	Add support for POSIX regular expressions.
	
	* regex-posix.c, regex-posix.h: New files. (Some code
	is taken liberally from rx/rgx.c in the old Guile dist.)

	* init.c: Include regex-posix.h.
	(scm_boot_guile_1): Call scm_init_regex_posix.
	
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_libguile_la_SOURCES, modinclude_HEADERS):
	Add regex-posix.[ch] sources.
	* Makefile.in: Regenerated.
	
	* scmconfig.h.in: Add HAVE_REGCOMP macro.  (automake is supposed
	to do this automatically?  It didn't for me, bleh.)
	
Mon May 26 18:51:29 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* fports.c (print_pipe_port): New function.
	(scm_fptob): Use print_pipe_port instead of scm_prinport; the
	latter doesn't even take the right arguments.

	* Makefile.am: Increment shared lib revision number.  I think
	sometimes the uninstalled Guile finds the installed shared lib;
	Gord says doing this might help.  As things turned out, I can't
	say whether it does.
	* Makefile.in: Regenerated.

	* gh_init.c (gh_enter): Cast c_main_prog to a void * before
 	passing it as the closure argument to scm_boot_guile.  (Bill
 	Janssen)
	
	* ports.c (print_void_port, putc_void_port, puts_void_port,
	write_void_port, flush_void_port, getc_void_port, close_void_port,
	noop0): Use ANSI prototypes instead of K&R declarations, so the
	initialization of void_port_ptob gets aggressively type-checked.
	Fix arguments of print_void_port and write_void_port.  (Bill
	Janssen)

	* COPYING, __scm.h, _scm.h, alist.c, alist.h, append.c, append.h,

 	address for FSF.

Mon May 26 12:37:30 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* script.c (scm_find_executable): Use prototype-style definition
 	here; apparently it's not quite right to have const in a prototype
 	and then use a K&R declaration.  I wonder if stuff like this will
 	go away if we compile with -Wrequire-prototypes, or whatever that
 	is...  (Bernard URBAN)

	* scmhob.h: New text from Bernard URBAN.

Sat May 17 17:14:36 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* script.c: Don't #define const on hpux.  Configure takes care of
	this.  (Thanks to Larry Schwimmer.)

	* script.c: Use the HAVE_UNISTD_H symbol provided by autoconf to
	decide whether to #include <unistd.h>, instead of listing a bunch
	of systems.  Don't #include stdio twice.  Removed dyked-out
	definition of scm_find_impl_file.

Fri May 16 03:06:08 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.am (libguile_la_LDFLAGS): Update libguile's shared
	library version info to 1:0.
	* Makefile.in: Regenerated.

	* backtrace.c, backtrace.h, debug.c, debug.h, eq.c,
 	gdb_interface.h, gdbint.c, gdbint.h, gh_data.c, gh_init.c,
 	gh_io.c, gh_list.c, gh_predicates.c, gh_test_c.c, gh_test_repl.c,

 	script.h, snarf.h, srcprop.c, srcprop.h, stacks.c, stacks.h,
 	throw.c: Update copyright years; these files have been worked on
	significantly in 1997, but only had copyright years for 1996.
	Also, change name of copyright holder on some from Mikael
	Djurfeldt to Free Software Foundation; he has signed papers
	assigning the changes to the FSF.
	
	* script.c (scm_shell_usage): Pass FATAL to exit.  There's no
	reason not to give the user the option.

	* net_db.c (scm_gethost, scm_getnet, scm_getproto, scm_getserv):
	Return #f on end-of-file when scanning table (i.e. when called
	with no arguments).  Try to catch errors, when we can.
	* posix.c (scm_getgrgid, scm_getpwuid): Same.
	
	* script.h (scm_shell_usage, scm_compile_shell_switches): New
	external declarations.  These are useful.

Thu May 15 05:21:36 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* posix.c: don't include <sys/select.h> or define macros for
	select, since they were not used in this file.

	* filesys.c (scm_select): make the fifth parameter microseconds,
	not milliseconds.  let the fourth parameter be either a real value
	or an integer or #f.  The first, second and third arguments can
	now be vectors: the type of the corresponding return set will be
	the same.
	(set_element, get_element): new static procedures.

Wed May 14 12:18:12 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* strports.c (scm_eval_string): New function.
	(scm_eval_0str): Trivially re-implemented in terms of
	scm_eval_string.
	* strports.h (scm_eval_string): New extern decl.

	* net_db.c (h_errno): Add extern decl for this.

	* fports.c (local_pclose): New function.
	(scm_pipob): Use it in the initializer here.

	From Tim Pierce:
	* net_db.c (scm_gethost, scm_getproto, scm_getnet, scm_getserv):
	Use a meaningful error message when signalling an error.  For
	this, scm_gethost must check h_errno rather than errno.

Tue May 13 16:40:06 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in: Regenerated, using automake-1.1p.

Tue May 13 04:34:52 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* socket.c (scm_addr_vector): use SCM_UNDEFINED in scm_listify,
	not SCM_UNSPECIFIED.

	* script.c (scm_compile_shell_switches): don't append (quit) if
	interactive.
	(scm_shell): call scm_exit_status and exit on the result of the
	evaluation.

Mon May 12 17:23:58 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	Ensure that shared substrings are handled properly when passed to
	a system call or other foreign function.  Many thanks to Tim
	Pierce!
	* symbols.h (SCM_COERCE_SUBSTR): new macro.
	* filesys.c (scm_chmod, scm_rename, scm_delete_file, scm_mkdir,
 	scm_rmdir, scm_opendir, scm_chdir, scm_symlink, scm_readlink,
 	scm_lstat), ports.c (scm_sys_make_void_port), posix.c (scm_utime,
 	scm_putenv, scm_setlocale, scm_mknod), stime.c (setzone,
 	scm_strftime), vports.c (scm_make_soft_port), backtrace.c
 	(scm_display_error_message): use RO macros when strings may be RO.
	* error.c (scm_error_scm), filesys.c (scm_chown, scm_chmod,
 	scm_rename, scm_delete_file, scm_mkdir, scm_rmdir, scm_opendir,
 	scm_chdir, scm_symlink, scm_readlink, scm_lstat), ioext.c
 	(scm_freopen, scm_duplicate_port, scm_fdopen), net_db.c
 	(scm_gethost, scm_getnet, scm_getproto, scm_getserv), ports.c
 	(scm_sys_make_void_port), posix.c (scm_getgrgid, scm_utime,
 	scm_setlocale, scm_mknod), stime.c (setzone, scm_strptime,
 	scm_strftime), vports.c (scm_make_soft_port): use
 	SCM_COERCE_SUBSTR to make sure shared substrings are
 	null-terminated.

Mon May 12 15:33:10 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* error.c (scm_error): Add newline to error message.

	* init.c (scm_init_standard_ports): Doc fix.

Thu May  8 14:38:01 1997  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* dynl-shl.c: Completely replaced with new code from Bernard
 	URBAN.

	* script.c (scm_ice_9_already_loaded): New variable.
	(scm_compile_shell_switches): Use it.

Mon May  5 20:35:08 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* filesys.c (scm_input_waiting_p): add missing third argument to
	scm_misc_error.

	* stime.c (scm_localtime): copy the result of localtime before
	calling gmtime in case they share a buffer.
	(scm_localtime, scm_mktime): throw an error if neither HAVE_TM_ZONE
	nor HAVE_TZNAME.

Fri May  2 19:07:11 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* eq.c (scm_equal_p): use SCM_TYP7SD (y) not SCM_TYP7SD (x).
	
Thu May  1 17:01:45 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.am (check-local): New target, which causes 'make check'
 	to run gh_test_c and gh_test_repl, with some trivial input.
	* Makefile.in: Rgnrtd.

Tue Apr 29 19:00:40 1997  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* dynl.c (print_dynl_obj): Indicate whether the dynamic object has
 	been unlinked.

Mon Apr 28 06:10:14 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* async.c (scm_sys_tick_async_thunk): commented out.  I'm not
	sure how this was supposed to work.
	(scm_async_click): don't send SCM_TICK_SIGNAL.
	(scm_init_async): don't initialize %tick-thunk.

	* the following change doesn't affect the Scheme interface:
 	gc-thunk is called at the end of garbage collection.  however it's
 	no longer implemented by pretending it's a signal.
	
	* gc.c (scm_gc_end): don't call scm_take_signal.  instead mark the
	system async corresponding to scm_gc_thunk.
	* async.h: declare scm_gc_async.
	* async.c (scm_sys_gc_async_thunk): apply the thunk named by
	gc-thunk directly, instead of going through a signal handler.
	(scm_gc_async): new variable, points to the GC system-async.
	(scm_init_async): save the GC async as scm_gc_async instead
	of using system_signal_asyncs.
	(scm_gc_vcell): new variable, stores the gc-thunk vcell.

Mon Apr 28 19:14:44 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.am (libpath.h, cpp_err_symbols.c, cpp_sig_symbols.c):
	Don't screw up if we're interrupted.
	* Makefile.in: Regeneradet.

Sun Apr 27 17:57:15 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* aclocal.m4: Removed; unnecessary, given changes of Apr 24.

	* Makefile.am (modincludedir): Use "ice-9" instead of "@module@";
	we're not using AM_INIT_GUILE_MODULE any more.
	* Makefile.in: Reneregated.

Thu Apr 24 00:41:08 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	Functions for finding variable bindings, grace à Tim Pierce.
	* gh_data.c (gh_lookup, gh_module_lookup): New functions.
	* gh.h (gh_lookup, gh_module_lookup): New prototypes.

	Get 'make dist' to work again.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Remove PLUGIN files.
	* Makefile.in: Regenerated, like a surry without a fringe on top.

	Changes for reduced Guile distribution: one configure script,
	no plugins.
	* configure.in, configure: Removed.
	* acconfig.h, acinclude.m4: Moved to parent directory, where the
	real configure script lives.
	* Makefile.in, scmconfig.h.in: Regenerated.

	* init.c: #include "script.h", to get prototype for script.c's
 	init function.

Wed Apr 23 21:25:39 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* gh_data.c (gh_scm2newstr, gh_symbol2newstr): Use
	scm_must_malloc, not raw malloc.

	* script.c (scm_compile_shell_switches): Dyke out debugging output
	code.

Mon Apr 21 05:00:32 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* eq.c (scm_equal_p): use "SCM_TYP7SD", not "SCM (TYP7SD".

	* stime.c: include both <sys/times.h> and <sys/timeb.h> if the
	system has them.  Hope this is safe.  Previously
	sys/timeb.h was included if HAVE_FTIME was defined or if
	HAVE_SYS_TIMEB_H was defined but HAVE_SYS_TIMES_H was not,
	but IRIX iris 5.3 apparently has ftime but not sys/timeb.h.

	* ioext.c (scm_setfileno): add missing third argument to
	scm_misc_error call.

Sun Apr 20 15:09:31 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* eq.c (scm_equal_p): Correctly compare strings of different
	varieties.  (Thanks to Tim Pierce.)

Sat Apr 19 03:59:02 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* read.c (skip_scsh_block_comment): SCSH says the !# that ends a
 	#! block comment must occur on a line all by itself.

        Move most of the guts of shell command processing into libguile,
	so guile.c can be very small (and eventuallly auto-generated.  (I
	mean, generated mechanically, not self-generated.  Hmm.))
	* guile.c, script.c, script.h: New source files.
	* init.c (scm_boot_guile_1): Call scm_init_script.
	* libguile.h: #include "script.h".
	* Makefile.am (bin_PROGRAMS, guile_SOURCES, guile_LDADD): New
	targets, for new executable.
	(libguile_la_SOURCES): Mention script.c.
	(modinclude_HEADERS): Add script.h.
	* configure.in: Always check for -lm, -lsocket, -lnsl, whether or
	not dynamic linking is enabled.  This is because we're generating
	executables now.  Move CY_AC_WITH_THREADS call after those, so the
	values of cy_cv_threads_libs captures the libs chosen above.
	* Makefile.in, configure, aclocal.m4: Regenerated.

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Don't distribute gscm.c or gscm.h.
	We don't maintain this interface any more, and it just confuses
	people.

	* alloca.c: #include <scmconfig.h>, not <config.h>.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_libguile_la_SOURCES): Mention alloca.c, so
	it'll get included in disties.

Thu Apr 17 17:45:10 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* gscm.c, gscm.h: These aren't supported any more, and shouldn't
	be distributed, because they confuse people.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Remove gscm.c, gscm.h.

Sat Apr 19 11:56:18 1997  Tim Pierce  <twp@twp.tezcat.com>

	* configure.in: check for presence of gethostent (not present on
	OpenBSD by default).
	* net_db.c (scm_gethost): Check HAVE_GETHOSTENT.
	* configure, scmconfig.h.in: Regenerated.

Wed Apr 16 17:52:38 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* backtrace.c (scm_backtrace): Split message string across
 	newlines properly.  GCC is more tolerant of this than other
 	compilers.

Mon Apr 14 20:20:14 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	Merge threads directory into libguile.
	* coop-defs.h, coop-threads.c, coop-threads.h, coop.c, threads.c,
	threads.h: New source files.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_libguile_la_SOURCES): Add threads.c.
	(noinst_HEADERS): Add coop-threads.c, coop-threads.h, coop.c
	here; see comment.
	(modinclude_HEADERS): Add threads.h, coop-defs.h.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Add fsu-pthreads.h, mit-pthreads.c, mit-pthreads.h,
	coop-threads.c.cygnus, coop-threads.h.cygnus.
	* configure.in: If we're using threads, include threads.o in
	LIBOBJS.
	* _scm.h, libguile.h: threads.h lives in this directory now.
	* fsu-pthreads.h, mit-pthreads.c, mit-pthreads.h,
	coop-threads.c.cygnus, coop-threads.h.cygnus: New files, not
	currently used, but brought along for information's sake.
	* ChangeLog-threads: log from old 'threads' directory.
	* Makefile.in, configure: Rebuilt.

Mon Apr 14 20:15:29 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* stime.c (scm_mktime): #ifndef HAVE_TM_ZONE, Use lt.tm_zone, not
	lt->tm_zone.

Mon Apr 14 01:32:57 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* gh_init.c (gh_standard_handler): Return SCM_BOOL_F, not garbage.

	Merge GH interface library into libguile.

	* Makefile.am (libguile_la_SOURCES): Add gh_data.c, gh_eval.c,
	gh_funcs.c, gh_init.c, gh_io.c, gh_list.c, gh_predicates.c.  Move

	(pkginclude_HEADERS): Add variable, to get gh.h installed.
	(THREAD_LIBS, check_ldadd, check_PROGRAMS, gh_test_c_SOURCES,
	gh_test_c_LDADD, gh_test_repl_SOURCES, gh_test_repl_LDADD):
	New variables, describing how to build the gh test programs.
	* configure.in: Check for -lm, -lsocket, -lnsl; we need this to
	build the test programs, and we probably should have been linking
	libguile.la against them all along, to support AIX shared libs.
	Add cflags for threads to CFLAGS; add libs for threads to new
	variable THREAD_LIBS, used in Makefile.am.
	* ChangeLog-gh: log from old `gh' subdirectory. 
	* Makefile.in, configure, scmconfig.h.in: Rebuilt.

Sun Apr 13 23:03:55 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

Fri Apr 11 19:39:32 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

 	* filesys.c (S_ISSOCK): Define this if it's missing, but we do
	have S_IFSOCK.  This is the case under Ultrix.

	* posix.c (scm_status_exit_val, scm_status_exit_val,
	scm_status_term_sig, scm_status_stop_sig): Modified to work with
	Ultrix versions of WIFSTOPPED, etc., which assume that their
	arguments are lvalues (hmm).

Thu Apr 10 15:10:07 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* eval.c: Doc fixes.

	* throw.c: Doc fixes; rearranged.

	readability.
	* Makefile.in: Rebuild.

Wed Apr  9 09:08:54 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	(bdtime2c, setzone, restorezone): new static procedures.
	(scm_mktime, scm_strftime): use them.
	(scm_strftime): don't call mktime before strftime.  Use
	filltime for return value.
	(filltime): convert NULL zname to #f.
	(scm_strptime): return a count of characters consumed, not
	the remaining string.

Sun Apr  6 05:44:11 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* stime.c (scm_localtime): check HAVE_TM_ZONE and HAVE_TZNAME.

	* stime.c (scm_init_stime): don't define ticks/sec.
	(scm_gettimeofday): renamed from scm_time_plus_ticks (avoids multiple
	return value problem and is still portable.)

Sat Apr  5 17:59:24 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* cpp_err_symbols.in: Renamed from cpp_err_symbols, to avoid
	make's implicit cpp_err_symbols: cpp_err_symbols.c rule.
	* cpp_sig_symbols.in: Renamed from cpp_sig_symbols.
	* Makefile.am (check_errnos, check_signals, cpp_sig_symbols.c,
	cpp_err_symbols.c): Corresponding changes.
	* Makefile.in: Regenerated.

Sat Apr  5 02:39:02 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* posix.c (scm_putenv): don't check HAVE_PUTENV.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_libguile_la_SOURCES): add putenv.c.
	* configure.in: move putenv from AC_CHECK_FUNCS to AC_REPLACE_FUNCS.
	* putenv.c: new file, from sh-utils 1.12.

	* posix.c (scm_environ): use malloc in place of scm_must_malloc
	since allocation isn't for Scheme objects.
	(scm_putenv): copy strings before placing in the environment.

	* stime.c (scm_current_time): throw an error if time returns -1,
	instead of returning #f.
	(scm_get_internal_real_time, scm_get_internal_real_time): use
	scm_long2num for return value instead of SCM_MAKINUM.

	* stime.h: prototypes updated.

Fri Apr  4 08:53:41 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* configure.in: check for gettimeofday.

	* stime.c (scm_time_plus_ticks): new procedure, an scsh interface
	which may be more usefully portable than a gettimeofday interface.

Wed Apr  2 17:11:39 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): It's cpp_err_symbols, not
	cpp_err_signals.
	* Makefile.in: Regenerated.

Mon Mar 31 03:22:37 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* stime.c (filltime): recovered static procedure.
	(scm_localtime, scm_gmtime, scm_mktime, scm_tzset): recovered from

	(scm_close_pipe): new procedure.

	* posix.c (scm_open_input_pipe, scm_open_output_pipe): deleted,
	define them in boot-9.scm

Wed Mar 26 04:10:32 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* ioext.c (scm_setfileno): throw a runtime error if SET_FILE_FD_FIELD
	wan't defined.  Don't include fd.h.

	* Previously fd.h was regenerated whenever configure was run,
	forcing a couple of files to be recompiled.

	* fd.h.in: deleted, SET_FILE_FD_FIELD moved to ioext.c.
	* configure.in: AC_DEFINE FD_SETTER instead of HAVE_FD_SETTER.
	Check for _fileno as well as _file.
  	Don't output fd.h.
	* ioext.c: don't fd.h.
	* acconfig.h: remove duplicate HAVE_FD_SETTER and change the
	other to FD_SETTER.

	* Change the stratigy for getting information about errno
 	(and now signal number) values, e.g., ENOSYS, SIGKILL.  Instead of
 	generating lists of symbols during the build process, which will
 	not always work, include comprehensive lists in the distribution.
  	To help keep the lists up to date, the "check_signals" and
 	"check_errnos" make targets can be used.
	
	* configure.in: don't check for a command to extract errno codes.
	* Makefile.am: update file lists, remove errnos.list and errnos.c
	targets, add cpp_err_symbols.c, cpp_sig_symbols.c, check_signals,
	check_errnos targets.
	(CLEANFILES): remove errnos.c and errnos.list, add
 	cpp_err_symbols_here cpp_err_symbols_diff cpp_err_symbols_new
	cpp_sig_symbols_here cpp_sig_symbols_diff cpp_sig_symbols_new
	* errnos.default: deleted.
	* cpp_signal.c: new file.
	* cpp_errno.c: renamed from errnos_get.c.
	* cpp_err_symbols, cpp_sig_symbols: new files.
	* cpp_cnvt.awk: renamed from errnos_cnvt_awk.
	* error.c (scm_init_error): #include cpp_err_symbols instead of
	errnos.c.
	* posix.c (scm_init_posix): don't intern signal symbols.  #include
	cpp_sig_symbols.c.

Tue Mar 25 04:51:10 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* strop.c (scm_i_index): allow the lower bound to be equal to the
	length of the string, so a null string doesn't always give an error.

	* posix.h: new prototypes.
	* posix.c (scm_status_exit_val, scm_status_term_sig,
	scm_status_stop_sig): new functions, as in scsh.  They break down
	process status values as returned by waitpid.

Sat Mar 22 18:16:29 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>
	
	* net_db.c (scm_gethost): don't check HAVE_GETHOSTENT, since 
	configure doesn't know about it.

Fri Mar 21 23:49:28 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* snarf.h, backtrace.c: Name change SCM_GLOBAL --> SCM_VCELL.

	* snarf.h: Added new macros SCM_GLOBAL_SYMBOL and SCM_GLOBAL_VCELL
	which defines C variables with global linkage.

Mon Mar 17 05:57:11 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* snarf.h (SCM_PROC1): Bugfix: Use (void) rather than (...) for
	zero arg subrs.

Sun Mar 16 11:43:49 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@floss.cyclic.com>

 	* eval.c (safe_setjmp): Temporarily use old setjmp until someone
 	has time to check why this doesn't work well with continuations.

Sun Mar 16 05:09:55 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* Fix shell syntax error; some shells won't tolerate 
	multiple "fi" statements on a single line.  (Thanks to Fred Fish.)

Sat Mar 15 01:11:40 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* posix.c (scm_uname): throw an error if uname fails instead
	of returning errno.

	* error.h (scm_errno, scm_perror): obsolete prototypes removed.

	* error.c (err_head, scm_errno, scm_perror): obsolete procedures
	removed.

	* async.c (scm_ints_disabled): definition moved from error.c.

Sat Mar 15 00:06:08 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* acconfig.h: Removed PACKAGE.

	* scmconfig.h.in: Regenerated.

	* snarf.h: g++ says it's non-portable not to specify the first
 	argument in a varargs declaration.  I introduced the first
 	argument by using preprocessor conditionals.

Thu Mar 13 21:28:25 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* ioext.c (scm_read_delimited_x): use RO string macros for delims.
	(scm_freopen): use RO string macros for filename and modes.
	(scm_duplicate_port, scm_fdopen): use RO string macros for modes.

	* posix.c (scm_getgrgid): simplify conversion of name to C string.
	(scm_mknod): use RO string macros for path.

	* socket.c (scm_fill_sockaddr, scm_send, scm_sendto):
	use SCM_ROSTRINGP, SCM_ROCHARS, SCM_ROLENGTH.
	
	* net_db.c (scm_gethost, scm_getnet, scm_getproto, scm_getserv):
	use SCM_ROSTRINGP and SCM_ROCHARS.

Thu Mar 13 18:31:33 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* unif.c (scm_array_set_x): Cast ICHR (obj) to char if storing in
	a scm_tc7_byvect.

	* ramap.c (scm_ra_matchp, scm_array_fill_int, racp,
 	scm_array_index_map_x, raeql_1, scm_array_equal_p): Completed
 	support for byte vectors.

	* print.c (scm_iprin1): Limit number of vector elements printed
	according to pstate->length.

Thu Mar 13 00:12:35 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* backtrace.c (scm_display_error_message): don't segv if message
	is an immediate.

	* error.h: prototype for scm_error_scm.

	* error.c (scm_error_scm): new procedure, reimplements scm-error
	in C and uses scm_error.

Tue Mar 11 03:51:00 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* read.c (scm_read_hash_extend): make scm_read_hash_procedures a 
	pointer to the Scheme variable read-hash-procedures and intern it
 	in scm_init_read. Modify scm_read_hash_extend and 
	scm_get_hash_procedure to use the pointer.

Mon Mar 10 06:28:54 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>	

	* read.h (SCM_N_READ_OPTIONS): increase SCM_N_READ_OPTIONS to 4.
	(SCM_KEYWORD_STYLE): defined.

	* read.c (scm_read_opts): add a keywords option.  This isn't a
 	boolean option, in case someone wants to add support for DSSSL
 	keywords too.
	Setup scm_keyword_prefix symbol.
	(scm_lreadr): Only process keywords if SCM_KEYWORD_STYLE is
	set to 'prefix.
	I've left keyword support disabled by default, since it doesn't
	seem to break the module system and it gives R4RS standard behaviour.
	It can be reactivated with (read-set! keywords 'prefix).

Sun Mar  9 14:14:39 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* arbiters.c (scm_make_arbiter): Bugfix: Must SCM_DEFER_INTS
	before constructing arbiter.

	* eval.c (scm_m_define): Bugfix: Check that the object is a
	closure before setting the procedure property!

	* ports.h: Removed prototype for scm_ungetc_char_ready_p.

	* ports.c: Removed `ungetc-char-ready?'.

Sat Mar  8 00:27:05 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* read.c (scm_init_read): intitialise scm_read_hash_procedures
	(idea from Mikael: make it a pair so scm_permanent object only
	called once.)
	(scm_read_hash_extend): don't call scm_permanent_object.
	(ideas from Mikael): if chr is already in the list, replace its
	procedure instead of appending it again.  If proc is #f, remove
	it from the list.
	(scm_get_hash_procedure): take CDR of scm_read_hash_procedures.

	* strports.c (scm_read_0str, scm_eval_0str): update scm_read usage.

	* gdbint.c (gdb_read): update scm_lreadr usage.

	* load.h: update prototypes.

	* load.c (scm_primitive_load, scm_read_and_eval_x,
	scm_primitive_load_path): remove case_insensitive_p, sharp arguments.

	* read.h: add prototype for scm_read_hash_extend.  Change args for
	other prototypes.
	
	* read.c (scm_read_hash_procedures): new variable.
	(scm_read_hash_extend): new procedure.
	(scm_get_hash_procedure): new procedure.
	(scm_lreadr): use scm_get_hash_procedure instead of an argument
	for extended # processing.
	(scm_read, scm_lreadr, scm_lreadrecparen, scm_lreadparen,
	scm_read_token): remove case_i, sharp arguments.  Change callers.

Fri Mar  7 08:58:21 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* read.h (SCM_N_READ_OPTIONS): increase to 3.
	(SCM_CASE_INSENSITIVE_P): define.

	* read.c: add case-insensitive option to scm_read_opts.
	(scm_read_token): use SCM_CASE_INSENSITIVE_P instead of an argument
	to determine whether to convert symbol case.
	(default_case_i): definition removed.
	* read.c (scm_read_token): if case_i, downcase ic before doing
	anything with it.

Sat Mar  8 03:49:03 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* configure.in: Added configuration option `guile-debug'.
	Configure with --enable-guile-debug if you want a bunch of extra
	functions used for debugging when developing Guile.

	* acconfig.h: Added new preprocessor symbol GUILE_DEBUG.

	* procs.c (make-cclo): New undocumented debugging procedure: Make
	compiled closure with internal procedure PROC and length LENGTH.
	Only compiled if GUILE_DEBUG is defined.

	* debug.c: Only include `debug-hang' if GUILE_DEBUG is defined.

	* print.c: Put #ifdef GUILE_DEBUG around `current-pstate'.

	* ports.c: Changed preprocessor symbol DEBUG --> GUILE_DEBUG.

	* eval.c (SCM_CEVAL): Added code sections for handling of rpsubrs
	with 3 or more args internally to the evaluator.

Fri Mar  7 19:38:18 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* eval.c (SCM_CEVAL): Added code sections for handling of asubrs
	with 3 or more args internally to the evaluator.  This is mainly
	because we don't want to pass entry and exit points of the
	debug support twice, but it also seems to increase the speed of
	the evaluator for such calls (e. g. (+ 1 2 3)).

	* backtrace.c (scm_display_application): New procedure:
	display-application; Set fancy printing parameters individually
	for different types of display (backtrace, error, application).
	(These should of course be customizable!)

	* debug.h (SCM_RESET_DEBUG_MODE): Bugfix: The old code didn't
 	clear the CHECK-flags.

Thu Mar  6 00:53:02 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* tags.h, eval.c (iqq): Fixes to comments about SCM_ECONSP.

Wed Mar  5 23:31:21 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* tags.h (SCM_ECONSP, SCM_NECONSP): Bugfix: Discriminate structs
	from pairs with a GLOC in the car.

	* symbols.c (msymbolize): Bugfix: Also initialize SCM_SYMBOL_HASH,
	otherwise `symbol-hash' will behave badly.
	(scm_symbol_hash): Bugfix: Must msymbolize if tc7_ssymbol, othwise
	we get segmentation fault!

	* symbols.c: Added #include "weaks.h".  New functions:
 	`builtin-bindings' and `builtin-weak-bindings'.  (These will be
 	moved to an extraneous library when we split libguile.)

Tue Mar  4 19:50:07 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* filesys.c (scm_stat): stat now takes fport arguments too as
	documented in the manual.

Mon Mar  3 07:11:33 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* debug.c (scm_single_step): Bugfix: Call continuation with
	scm_call_continuation instead of throwing to it.

Mon Mar  3 09:07:56 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* ports.c (scm_char_ready_p): bug fix: in SCM_PROC char-ready's
 	argument wasn't declared to be optional.

Sun Mar  2 16:34:40 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* stime.c (scm_init_stime): Add feature "current-time".

Sun Mar  2 06:37:31 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* throw.h: prototype for scm_exit_status.
	* throw.c (scm_handle_by_message): if a 'quit is caught, use its
	args to derive an exit status.  Allows (quit) to work from a
	script.
	(scm_exit_status): new function.
	#include "eq.h".

Sat Mar  1 00:09:15 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* eval.c (scm_deval): Removed some old code.
	(ENTER_APPLY): Bugfix: Reset apply-frame trap on trap as is done
	with the others.
	(ENTER_APPLY, scm_deval): Reset trace flag on apply-frame and
	exit-frame traps.

	* symbols.c (msymbolize): Bugfix: Must initialize property list to
 	SCM_EOL.

	* procs.c: Introduce the existent C function scm_thunk_p at the
	Scheme level as well.

Wed Feb 26 12:53:58 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* symbols.c, symbols.h (scm_symbol_value0): New function.  Can be
 	used from C to easily lookup the value of a symbol in the current
 	module.

Tue Feb 25 00:14:10 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* unif.c (scm_init_unif): Added #include "unif.x".  (There are two
	scm_init_unif in this file.  This will also fix a previous problem
	with guile-snarf.)

	* configure.in: Added AM_MAINTAINER_MODE

Fri Feb 21 23:07:26 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* gdb_interface.h (GDB_INTERFACE): Added some (void *) casts to
	avoid warnings.

Fri Feb 21 18:00:38 1997  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_libguile_la_SOURCES): New variable to hold
 	source files that are not always included in libguile but should
 	have their dependencies calculated by automake.  This variable is
 	recognized by automake, no further magic is needed.
	(libguile_la_DEPENDENCIES): Changed to @LIBLOBJS@.  Libtool wants
 	to deal exclusively with *.lo files, as it seems.  The *.o files
 	are built automatically when the corresponding *.lo file gets
 	built.

Wed Feb 19 14:04:23 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* list.h (scm_list_cdr_ref): Delete prototype; function no longer
	exists.

Tue Feb 11 18:19:47 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.am (libguile_la_SOURCES): Remove backtrace.c, debug.c,
 	inet_aton.c, srcprop.c, stacks.c, and strerror.c from this list.
  	They should only be included in the library at configure.in's
 	discretion.
	(libguile_la_LDADD): Include the appropriate .lo files here.
	(libguile_la_DEPENDENCIES): List the corresponding .o files here,
	so we know when to build them (and their .lo bretheren).
	* configure.in (LIBLOBJS): New substituted variable.  We let
 	configure decide which .o files to include in LIBOBJS, and then
 	put the corresponding list of .lo files in LIBLOBJS.  The latter
	is what we pass to libtool.
	* Makefile.in, configure: regenerated.

Mon Feb 10 00:08:08 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@kenneth>

	* symbols.c (scm_sysintern0): New function.  Contains the core of
 	old scm_sysintern but doesn't take a second value argument.
	(scm_sysintern): Now uses scm_sysintern0.
	(scm_sysintern_no_module_lookup): Renamed to
 	scm_sysintern0_no_module_lookup and doesn't take a second value
 	argument any longer.

	* symbols.h (scm_sysintern0: Added declaration.
	
	* options.c (scm_init_opts): Use scm_sysintern0 instead of
 	scm_sysintern when interning option keys.  Otherwise we risk
 	destroying the values of already interned variables.

	* symbols.c (scm_sym2vcell): Bugfix: Treat definedp as
	scheme-level boolean (use SCM_NFALSEP).

	* backtrace.c (scm_init_backtrace): Make Scheme-level variable
 	`the-last-stack'.
	(scm_backtrace): New function. (C version of old function from
 	boot-9.scm) Motivation: Make it possible to display backtraces
 	without depending on boot-9.scm.  (I'm uncertain if this
 	motivation is good enough...)

	* root.h (scm_root_state): Add member the_last_stack_var.
	(scm_the_stack_var): Defined to scm_root->the_last_stack_var.

	* root.c (mark_root): Mark scm_the_last_stack_var.

	* init.c (scm_start_stack): Initialize scm_the_last_stack_var to
 	SCM_BOOL_F.

Sun Feb  9 18:04:41 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@kenneth>

	* throw.c (mark_lazy_catch, free_lazy_catch): Removed.
	1. mark_lazy_catch didn't mark the smob.
	2. Both functions above have standard variants:
	(lazy_catch_funs): Changed mark_lazy_catch --> scm_mark0,
	free_lazy_catch --> scm_free0.

Fri Feb  7 17:30:26 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* throw.c (scm_internal_lazy_catch): New function.
	(scm_lazy_catch): Rewritten to use it.
	(scm_ithrow): Handle the new lazy catch representation.
	Use SCM_LAZY_CATCH_P, instead of assuming that any wind list entry
 	that doesn't have a jmpbuf is a lazy catch clause.
	(tc16_lazy_catch, struct lazy_catch, mark_lazy_catch,
	free_lazy_catch, print_lazy_catch, lazy_catch_funs,
	make_lazy_catch, SCM_LAZY_CATCH_P): Support funs, including a new
	smob.
	(scm_init_throw): Register the new lazy-catch smob type.
	* throw.h (scm_internal_lazy_catch): decl for new function.

	* throw.c (scm_internal_catch): Doc fixes.

	* alloca.c: New file, needed to support the AC_FUNC_ALLOCA call in
	configure.in.  Including this might cause problems if applications
	that link against libguile include their own copies of alloca, but
	if they're using autoconf, they should be adding libguile to LIBS
	before calling AC_FUNC_ALLOCA anyway, in which case they'll find
	the copy in libguile, and things will be okay.  (I think.)

Thu Feb  6 03:10:32 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* strop.c (scm_string_upcase_x, scm_string_downcase_x):	moved from
	unif.c.
	strop.h: move prototypes too.

Wed Feb  5 08:33:00 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* posix.c (scm_init_posix): don't intern EINTR since it's now done
	elsewhere.

	* ioext.c (scm_init_ioext): don't intern stat macros, S_IRUSR
	etc.  I deleted them from filesys.c long ago, but didn't
	notice they were here too (although ineffective since 
	sys/stat.h wasn't included).

Tue Feb  4 18:17:50 1997  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

	* eval.c: Don't define alloca in GCC case.  gcc will automatically
	use __builtin_alloca if appropriate.

Tue Feb  4 16:57:40 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* eval.c (safe_setjmp): New function: trivial wrapper for setjmp.
	(SCM_CEVAL, SCM_APPLY): Call it, instead of setjmp, to make sure
	that values of automatic variables are preserved.  See comments
	for safe_setjmp for details.

	Change from Thomas Morgan:
        * variable.c: Include eq.h.
        (var_equal): New function.
	(variable_smob): Use var_equal as the discriminator for variables.

	* throw.c (s_throw): Remove extraneous declaration.

	* configure.in: Call AC_FUNC_ALLOCA, to see if we have alloca.
	* eval.c: Add necessary CPP cruft to support that.
	* configure, Makefile.in, scmconfig.h.in: regenerated.

	Change from Thomas Morgan:
	* procprop.c (scm_procedure_properties): Convert the Scheme
	boolean returned by scm_procedure_p into a C boolean before using
	it as a condition for SCM_ASSERT.
	(scm_procedure_property): Likewise.

	* simpos.c (SYSTNAME): Accept both 'unix' and '__unix' as
	indications of Unixness.
	* stime.c: Same.

Tue Feb  4 05:07:35 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* net_db.c (scm_lnaof): change scheme name from lnaof to inet-lnaof.

Mon Feb  3 06:12:37 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* read.c (scm_lreadr): use scm_misc_error to improve one of the 
	"unknown # object" error messages.

	* strop.c (scm_i_index, scm_i_rindex): combine into one procedure
	(scm_i_index) and declare it static.  Add a 'direction' argument
	to indicate what way the search should go.
	(scm_i_index): throw out-of-range error instead	of wrong-type-arg
	if indices are bad.
	(scm_string_index, scm_string_rindex): adjust usage of scm_i_index.
	strop.h: remove scm_i_index, scm_i_rindex prototypes.

Fri Jan 31 04:33:11 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* ioext.c, ioext.h: remove obsolete _sys_ from 9 procedure names.
	
	* posix.c (scm_fork): Scheme name changed from fork to primitive-fork,
	to avoid clash with various scsh forks.

Thu Jan 30 20:14:09 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@syk-0606.pdc.kth.se>

	The following two changes (ramap.c, throw.c) are motivated by the
	apparent unportability of forward declarations of static arrays of
	the form `static foo bar[];'.
	
	* ramap.c (scm_array_fill_x): Moved above scm_array_fill_int.
	(ra_rpsubrs, ra_asubrs): Moved to the top of array code.

	* throw.c (scm_throw): Moved above scm_ithrow.

	* options.h: Removed the extern declarations of scm_yes_sym and
	scm_no_sym since these are static.

Fri Jan 24 06:16:32 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* ports.c: add SCM_PROC declarations for pt-size and pt-member.

	* Makefile.am: remove AWK=@AWK@.
	Add a rule for generating errnos.list.
	(CLEANFILES): put errnos.list here instead of in DISTCLEANFILES.

	* configure.in: add AC_SUBST(AWK) and AC_SUBST(ERRNO_EXTRACT).
	don't extract errnos, just set a variable (avoids the
	need to recompile error.c just because configure is run.)
	
	* unif.h: update prototypes.
	* unif.c (scm_uniform_array_read,write): change the offset and
	length arguments to start and end, for consistency.

	* __scm.h: uncomment SCM_ARG6 and SCM_ARG7, I needed SCM_ARG6.

	* ioext.h: update prototypes.
	* ioext.c (scm_read_delimited_x): replaces scm_read_line and
	scm_read_line_x, it's a more general procedure using an
	interface from scsh.  read-line and read-line! are now defined
	in boot-9.scm.
  	Note that the new read-line trims the terminator
	by default, previously it was appended to the returned string.  An
	optional argument specifies how to process the terminator (scsh
	compatible).  For the old behaviour: (read-line port 'concat).
	scm_read_line, scm_read_line_x: deleted.  (read-line port 'split)
	returns a pair, but is converted to multiple values if the scsh
	module is loaded.

	socket.h: update prototypes.
	* socket.c (scm_recvfrom): for consistency with other procedures,
	take start and end as separate optional arguments.
	(scm_recv, scm_recvfrom): don't allow the second argument
	to be a size, only a buffer.  Change the scheme names to
	recv! and recvfrom!.  Don't return the buffer.

	* ioext.h, posix.h: move prototypes too.
	* ioext.c, posix.c (scm_read_line, scm_read_line_x, scm_write_line:
	moved back from posix.c to ioext.c.  Also move #includes of "genio.h"
	"read.h" and "unif.h".
	* ioext.c: include "chars.h"

Mon Jan 20 19:54:49 1997  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* dynl.c: The dynamic linking and module registration functions
 	are now defined even when dynamic linking is not available for the
 	host system.  Some of their functionality can be done without
 	dynamic linking; when it's really needed, they throw errors.

Thu Jan 16 16:39:29 1997  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* configure.in: Only define DYNAMIC_LINKING when one of the system
 	dependent functions is detected.
	* dynl.c (scm_dynamic_func): New function to get the address of a
 	function in a dynamic object.
	(scm_dynamic_call, scm_dynamic_args_call): Accept the values
 	produced by scm_dynamic_func as the thing to call.

Sun Jan 12 21:09:42 1997  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* dynl.c, dynl-dl.c, dynl-dld.c, dynl-shl.c: Restructured.
	(scm_register_module_xxx, scm_registered_modules,
 	scm_clear_registered_modules): New functions.

Sat Jan 11 21:37:15 1997  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* symbols.c (scm_sysintern): Renamed to
 	scm_sysintern_no_module_lookup.
	(scm_sysintern): New function to take the place of the old
 	scm_sysintern. It uses the current toplevel lookup closure to give
 	the symbol its value.  This is a temporary hack to put packages
 	like gtcltk into their own module.
        (scm_can_use_top_level_lookup_closure_var): New variable to tell
 	us whether `scm_top_level_lookup_closure_var' has been initialized
 	and is usable.
	* eval.c (scm_init_eval): Set it.

Sat Jan 18 00:03:31 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* fports.c (scm_open_file): pass errno to scm_syserror_msg.
	* filesys.h: update prototypes.  Remove macros: SCM_FD_P, SCM_FD_FLAGS,
	SCM_FD.
	* filesys.c (scm_sys_stat, scm_sys_lstat): pass errno to
	scm_syserror_msg.
	(scm_sys_read_fd, scm_sys_write_fd, scm_sys_close, scm_sys_lseek,
	scm_sys_dup): deleted: FD capability will be added to other
	procedures.
	Remove support for the FD object type: scm_tc16_fd, scm_fd_print,
	scm_fd_free, fd_smob, scm_intern_fd.
	(scm_open): renamed from scm_sys_open.  Return a port instead of
	an FD object.  Make the mode argument optional.
	(scm_sys_create): deleted, it's just a special case of open.
	(scm_init_filesys): move interning of constants O_CREAT etc.,
	here (were previously using SCM_CONST_LONG macro).
	Add missing constants: O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, O_RDWR, O_CREAT.
	don't newsmob fd.
	(numerous _sys_ procedures): remove gratuitous _sys_ from names.
	include "fports.h" and <stdio.h>
	(scm_stat, scm_select): don't support FD objects.

	* error.h: adjust scm_syserror_msg prototype.
	* error.c (scm_syserror_msg): take an extra argument for errno.
	Using the global value didn't always work, since it could be
	reset by procedure calls in the message or args arguments.

	* fports.c (scm_setbuf0): call setbuf even if FIONREAD is not defined.
	I don't understand why the check was there (and what about the
	ultrix check?)
	
	* strop.c (scm_string_copy): allow shared substrings to be copied.

	* unif.h: corresponding change to prototypes.
	* unif.c (scm_uniform_array_read_x, scm_uniform_array_write_x):
 	recognize two new optional arguments: offset and length.  Allow
 	the port argument to be an integer (file descriptor, for scsh).
  	Include <unistd.h> for "read" prototype.

Tue Jan 14 02:42:02 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* socket.c: don't include filesys.h.

Mon Jan 13 03:47:04 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* Makefile.am: add AWK=@AWK@ (?)

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): add errnos_cnvt.awk, errnos.default,
	errnos_get.c.
	Add a rule to generate errnos.c from errnos.
	* error.c (scm_init_error): include errnos.c.
	* errnos_cnvt.awk: new file, converts the list of errno codes to
 	C expressions.
	* errnos_get.c: new file.
	* errnos.default: new file, contains errnos to try if they can't
 	be extracted from errno.h.
	* configure.in: if using GCC, try and extract errno codes from
	errno.h.
	Added AC_PROG_AWK.

Sat Jan 11 14:47:00 1997  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

 	* configure.in: Replaced AC_PROG_RANLIB with AM_PROG_LIBTOOL.
	* Makefile.am: Made libguile into a libtool library.
	* PLUGIN/guile.config: Removed "-L ../libguile" from xtra_cflags.
  	Set libtool_libs to indicate that libguile is a libtool library.
  	See guile/ChangeLog for details.
	* .cvsignore: ignore "*.lo", the libtool library objects.

Wed Jan  8 06:54:54 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* net_db.c (scm_getserv): add missing SCM_ALLOW_INTS.
	use htons in getservbyport argument.

Tue Jan  7 18:11:24 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* ports.h (SCM_PTOBNUM): Removed extraneous semicolon.
	* smob.h: (SCM_PTOBNUM): Removed entirely; this definition is a
	duplicate.

	* objprop.c (scm_object_property): No need to take the CDR of the
	value returned by scm_object_properties, since Aug 20 change.

	* configure.in: When checking for struct linger, #include
	<sys/types.h> as well as <sys/socket.h>.  I've never known
	<sys/types.h> to cause any portability problems, and Solaris's
	<sys/socket.h> needs it.
	* configure: Rebuilt.

	I think the Sun compiler has chosen a perverse way to interpret
	ANSI declarations combined with K&R definitions.  We'll
	appease it a little bit.  But when it invades France, we fight.
	* print.c (scm_iprlist): Change 'tlr' argument to an int.
	* print.h (scm_iprlist): Here too.
	* numbers.c (scm_divbigdig): Change definition to match
	declaration in numbers.h.
	* unif.c (scm_makflo): Change definition to match declaration in
	unif.h.

	* init.c (scm_boot_guile): Don't return the value of
	scm_boot_guile_1.  This function doesn't return a value;
	scm_boot_guile_1 doesn't return a value (or return at all).

	* eval.c (unmemocopy): Add a semicolon to appease the Sun
	compiler.

	* simpos.c (SYSTNAME): Add case for AIX; otherwise it won't
 	compile.  I have a feeling this function is a bad idea anyway ---
 	one should always test for features, not systems.

	* smob.h (SCM_SMOBNUM, SCM_PTOBNUM): Remove extraneous
	semicolons.  Only pure luck kept this from being noticed earlier.

Tue Jan  7 15:04:06 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@kenneth>

	* socket.c (scm_recvfrom): Added missing semicolon.

Mon Jan  6 20:39:08 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* socket.c (scm_recvfrom): allow buff_or_size to be a list containing
	the buffer and start and end positions for scsh networking
	implementation.

Sun Jan  5 13:53:53 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in: Revert previous change to this file; the problem
	is due to transient automake weirdness.
	* configure: Rebuilt.

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Distribute PLUGIN/guile.libs.in, not
	PLUGIN/guile.libs.  configure generates the latter from the former.
	* Makefile.in: Rebuilt.
	
	* configure.in: Call AM_PROG_INSTALL; the automake manual says we
	need this if we install scripts, like guile-snarf.
	* configure: Rebuilt.

Thu Jan  2 01:56:38 1997  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Added DYNAMIC-LINKING

Sat Dec 28 19:14:01 1996  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* socket.c (scm_addr_vector): fix faulty scm_listify.

Sat Dec 28 13:55:58 1996  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* read.c (scm_lreadr): Encountering EOF after skipping a SCSH
 	style block comment is no longer considered an error.
	
Fri Dec 27 13:44:23 1996  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* PLUGIN/guile.libs.in: New file.
	* PLUGIN/guile.libs: Removed from repository.
	* configure.in: Create PLUGIN/guile.libs from
 	PLUGIN/guile.libs.in.  This is for including additonal libraries
 	needed for dynamic linking.
  	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Distribute PLUGIN/guile.libs.in
 	instead of PLUGIN/guile.libs.
	
  	* Makefile.am: Added explicit dependency "dynl.o: dynl.x".
	
Sun Dec 22 23:06:14 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* list.c (scm_delq_x, scm_delv_x, scm_delete_x): Delete all
 	occurrences of the given element from the list, not just the
 	first.  This is how the Emacs Lisp functions behave, how the
 	analogous Common Lisp functions behave, and (I believe) how the
 	older Maclisp functions worked.  I realize that this change may
 	break code, but it seemed better to break it before the Guile
 	release than after.

	* gc.c (scm_protect_object, scm_unprotect_object): New functions.
	Their prototypes were already present in gc.h, but they weren't
	implemented.
	(scm_init_storage): Initialize scm_protects.
	* root.c (scm_protects): New element of scm_sys_protects.

	* net_db.h (scm_init_net_db): Fix spelling from scm_init_netdb.

Sat Dec 21 15:38:32 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* libguile.h: Added #include "libguile/net_db.h".

	* libguile.h: Don't #include "libguile/libpath.h", contrary to Oct
	30 change.  That file is only meant for communication between the
	configuration process and load.c.  If code linked against libguile
	wants to get at the paths mentioned in libpath.h, it can call
	functions declared in load.h.

Sat Dec 21 14:50:42 1996  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* libguile.h: Removed #include "libguile/fdsocket.h"

	* net_db.c: Added #include <sys/socket.h>.

Sat Dec 21 00:33:03 1996  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* filesys.c (scm_input_waiting_p): use select in preference to
	FIONREAD, since the latter doesn't detect EOF.
	Throw error if neither select nor FIONREAD available.

	* socket.c (scm_connect): take a port, not a fd object.
	(scm_fill_sockaddr): throw an error if fam is not recognised.
	(scm_bind): use scm_fill_sockaddr.
	(scm_listen): take a port, not a fd object.
	(scm_accept): take and return a port.  return #f in the car if
	address can't be got
	(scm_sock_fd_to_port): new procedure.
	(scm_socket): use scm_sock_fd_to_port.
	(scm_addr_vector): throw error if unrecognised address type.
	take an extra argument with the calling procedure name.
	(scm_getsockname): take a port.  return #f if address can't be got.
	(scm_getpeername): take a port.  return #f if address can't be got.
	(scm_recvfrom): take a port.  return #f for address component if can't
	be got.
	(scm_sendto, scm_socketpair, scm_getsockopt scm_shutdown, 
	scm_setsockopt, scm_recv, scm_send): take a port not a fd object.

Fri Dec 20 23:06:53 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* throw.c (scm_internal_catch): Make body funcs and handler funcs
 	use separate data pointers, to allow them to be designed
 	independently and reused.
	(scm_body_thunk, scm_handle_by_proc, scm_handle_by_message):
	Renamed from catch_body, catch_handler, and uncaught_throw; made
	generically useful.
	(struct scm_catch_body_data): Renamed from catch_body_data; moved
	to throw.h.
	(scm_catch): Use the above.
	(scm_throw): Don't bother printing a message for an uncaught
	throw; we establish a default handler in init.
	* throw.h (scm_internal_catch): Prototype updated.
	(scm_body_thunk, scm_handle_by_proc, scm_handle_by_message): New
	decls.
	(struct scm_body_thunk_data): New structure, used as data
	argument to scm_body_thunk.
	* init.c (struct main_func_closure): New structure, packaging up
	the data to pass to the user's main function.
	(scm_boot_guile): Create one.  Pass it to scm_boot_guile_1.
	(scm_boot_guile_1): Pass it through to invoke_main_func.  Use
	scm_internal_catch to establish a catch-all handler, using
	scm_handle_by_message.  This replaces the special-case code in
	scm_throw.
	(invoke_main_func): Body function for scm_internal_catch; invoke
	the user's main function, using the main_func_closure pointer to
	decide what to pass it.
	* root.c (struct cwdr_body_data): Remove handler_proc member.
	(cwdr): Use scm_handle_by_proc instead of cwdr_handler.
	(cwdr_handler): Removed.

Thu Dec 19 00:00:26 1996  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* socket.h (SCM_P): update bind prototype.
	* socket.c (scm_init_socket): intern PF_UNSPEC, PF_UNIX, PF_INET.
	include "feature.h".
	(scm_socket): return a port, not a file descriptor object.
	include "fports.h" and <unistd.h>
	(scm_bind): take a port, not a file descriptor object.
	take an extra argument for address args.

	* net_db.c (scm_init_net_db): intern INADDR_ANY, INADDR_BROADCAST,
	INADDR_NONE, INADDR_LOOPBACK.

Tue Dec 17 22:58:26 1996  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* init.c: include net_db.h and not fdsocket.h.
	(scm_boot_guile_1): call scm_init_net_db and not scm_init_fdsocket.

	* Makefile.am: corresponding changes.
	* socket.h: renamed from fdsocket.h, fix names.
	* net_db.h: renamed from socket.h, fix names.
	* socket.c: renamed from fdsocket.c.
	remove _sys from procedure names.
	(scm_init_socket): rename from scm_init_fdsocket.  include socket.x.
	add "socket" to features list.
	* net_db.c: renamed from socket.c.
	remove _sys from procedure names.
	(scm_init_net_db): rename from scm_init_socket.  include net_db.x.
	add "net-db" to features list.
	include "net_db.h".  don't include <sys/socket.h> or
	<sys/un.h>.

Thu Dec 19 14:03:24 1996  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* tags.h (scm_tags): Removed comma at end of last enumerator.

Thu Dec 19 02:54:59 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	Don't use GCC extensions to allocate space for debugging frames.
	(Here he goes again!  Why do we put up with this?!)
	* debug.h (scm_debug_frame): Make the 'vect' member a pointer to
	an scm_debug_info structure, not an in-line array of them.  Add
	'info' member, to say how many vect elements we've used, for eval
	frames.
	* eval.c (SCM_CEVAL): Use alloca to allocate space for vect.  Use
	a new variable debug_info_end to mark the end of vect, instead of
	the address of the 'info' pointer itself.
	[DEVAL] (ENTER_APPLY, SCM_CEVAL, SCM_APPLY): Remove casts of
	&debug to scm_debug_frame *; debug is a real scm_debug_frame now.
	(SCM_APPLY): Explicitly allocate space for debug.vect. 
	* debug.c (scm_m_start_stack): Same, for vframe.vect.
	* stacks.c: Adjusted for new debug frame structure.
	(RELOC_INFO, RELOC_FRAME): New macros.
	(stack_depth, read_frames): Use them, and new scm_debug_frame
	element 'info', instead of magically knowing that eval frames have
	an info pointer sitting after vect.
	(scm_make_stack, scm_stack_id, scm_last_stack_frame): Use
	RELOC_FRAME.
	(scm_init_stacks): Formatting tweaks.

Wed Dec 18 14:57:57 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	Give GCC more control flow information, so it can be sure that
	variables aren't used uninitialized.
	* error.h (scm_error, scm_syserror, scm_syserror_msg,
 	scm_sysmissing, scm_num_overflow, scm_out_of_range,
 	scm_wrong_num_args, scm_wrong_type_arg, scm_memory_error,
 	scm_misc_error): Tell GCC that these functions never return.
	* struct.c (scm_struct_ref, scm_struct_set_x): If we can't figure
	out the field type, call abort if SCM_ASSERT returns, to placate
	the optimizer.
	* stacks.c (scm_make_stack, scm_last_stack_frame): abort if
	scm_wta ever returns.  We can't handle this case anyway, and this
	gives the optimizer more information.
	* unif.c (scm_uniform_vector_ref, scm_array_set_x): Abort if
	scm_wta ever returns.

	In some cases, the code is fine, but GCC isn't smart enough to
 	figure that out; this usually happens when one variable is only
 	initialized and used when a particular condition holds true, and
 	we know that condition will never change within a given invocation
 	of the function.  In this case, we simply initialize the variables
 	to placate the compiler, hopefully to a value which will cause a
	crash if it is ever actually used.
	* print.c (scm_iprin1): Initialize mw_pos.
	* read.c (scm_lreadrecparen): Initialize tl2, ans2.
	* throw.c (scm_ithrow): Initialize dynpair.
	* unif.c (scm_uniform_vector_ref): Initialize cra.
	* struct.c (init_struct): Initialize prot.
	* mbstrings.c (scm_print_mb_symbol): Initialize mw_pos and inc.

	* strports.c (scm_eval_0str): Don't return uninitialized garbage
	if EXPR contains no expressions.

Wed Dec 18 11:43:22 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* eval.c, debug.h: Revert changes of Dec 16 and Nov 21.  They
	cause an infinite loop (???).  So much for the algebraic
	equivalency of variable-sized arrays and alloca...

Tue Dec 17 20:29:03 1996  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* backtrace.c (scm_display_error): Bugfix: scm_procedure_p returns
 	a SCM boolean, not a C boolean.

Sat Dec 14 23:21:45 1996  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* gc.c (SCM_MTRIGGER_HYSTERESIS): New memory management parameter.
 	(scm_must_malloc, scm_must_realloc): Added a hysteresis to the
 	rules for raising scm_mtrigger. Previously, unfortunate but not
 	unlikely circumstances could result in almost constant invokation
 	of the gc. Now, this situations should be less likely, but they
 	are not prevented completely.

Tue Dec 17 16:19:07 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* numbers.c (scm_fuck): Procedure removed; looks like old test
	code.
	* numbers.h: Prototype removed.
	
Mon Dec 16 18:20:32 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* debug.h (scm_debug_frame): Change `vect' member from an in-line
	array to a pointer, to match my Nov 21 change in eval.c.

Fri Dec 13 16:12:14 1996  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* libguile.h: Added #include "libguile/backtrace.h", #include
	"libguile/stacks.h".
	
	* strings.c (scm_string scm_make_string scm_string_ref
	scm_string_set_x scm_string_equal_p scm_string_append):
	Bugfix according to scm patch from Aubrey Jaffer:
 	Corrected long-standing
 	(not (eqv? (integer->char 128)
 		   (string-ref (make-string 1 (integer->char 128)) 0)))
 	bug found by John Kozak <jk@noontide.demon.co.uk>.

	* strports.c, strports.h: Make scm_eval_0str return the value of
	the last expression evaluated (previously, it returned void).

	* strports.c, strports.h: New function: scm_read_0str.  Does what
	it sounds like.

Tue Dec 10 23:38:43 1996  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* simpos.c (scm_getenv): return #f if string can't be found in the
	environment instead of throwing an exception, for compatibility
	with numerous other systems.

Mon Dec  9 23:23:35 1996  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.am (.c.x): Use guile-snarf.
	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): Generate guile-snarf; make it
	executable.
	* guile-snarf.in: New file, resurrected from old guile-snarf.sh.

Mon Dec  9 18:36:50 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@duality.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* backtrace.c (scm_display_error_message): Made non-static, and
	renamed from display_error_message.
	* backtrace.h (scm_display_error_message): Added extern decl.
	* throw.c (uncaught_throw): Use it to display the error message.

Mon Dec  9 10:10:38 1996  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

	* inet_aton.c: Use #if 0, not #ifdef 0.

Mon Dec  9 06:36:48 1996  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* ioext.c (scm_sys_ftell): use scm_long2num instead of SCM_MAKINUM
	to convert the returned value.
	(scm_sys_fseek): use scm_num2long instead of SCM_INUM to convert
	the offset argument.

Sun Dec  8 21:06:38 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@duality.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	Add new interface to catch/throw, usable from C as well as
	Scheme.
	* throw.h (scm_catch_body_t, scm_catch_handler_t): New types.
	(scm_internal_catch): New function, replaces...
	(scm_catch_apply): Deleted.
	* throw.c (scm_catch_apply): Deleted; replaced with a more general
	mechanism which is a bit more code, but can be used nicely from C
	and implement the Scheme semantics as well.
	(scm_internal_catch): This is the replacement; it's named after
	the analogous function in Emacs.
	(scm_catch): Reimplemented in terms of the above.
	(struct catch_body_data, catch_body, catch_handler): New
	functions, used by scm_catch.
	* root.c (cwdr): Reimplemented in terms of scm_internal_catch.
	(struct cwdr_body_data, cwdr_body, cwdr_handler): New functions;
	support for new cwdr.

	* Makefile.am (libpath.h): Re-incorporate Mikael's changes of Wed
	Oct 30.

Sun Dec  8 17:55:34 1996  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* acconfig.h: Added DYNAMIC_LINKING symbol.
	* configure.in: Add option and checks for dynamic linking.
        * dynl.c, dynl-dl.c, dynl-dld.c, dynl-shl.c, dynl-vms.c,
 	dynl.h:	New files for dynamic linking support.
  	* Makefile.am (libguile_a_SOURCES):
 	Added "dynl.c".
	(modinclude_HEADERS): Added "dynl.h".
	(EXTRA_DIST): Added "dynl-dl.c", "dynl-dld.c", "dynl-shl.c" and
 	"dynl-vms.c".
  	* init.c (scm_boot_guile_1): Call
 	scm_init_dynamic_linking to initialize dynamic linking support.

Thu Dec  5 22:47:53 1996  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* init.c (scm_boot_guile_1): Moved `live' variable to the toplevel
 	(as we Schemers say). It needs to be global, so that I can tweak
 	it for the proper operation of unexec.
	(scm_boot_guile_1_live): New variable, see above.

Sun Dec  1 00:00:49 1996  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

	* guile-snarf.sh: Removed.
	* PLUGIN/guile.libs: Added dependency for -lm.
	* acinclude.m4: Renamed from aclocal.m4.
	* PLUGIN/greet: Removed.
	* Makefile.am, aclocal.m4: New files.
	* configure.in: Updated for Automake.

Thu Nov 28 00:23:55 1996  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* eval.c (scm_definedp): Use top_level_lookup_closure_var
	and not top_level_lookup_thunk_var.

Wed Nov 27 22:04:19 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@baalperazim.frob.com>

	* Makefile.in (ancillary): List ChangeLog-scm, not ChangeLog.scm.

Wed Nov 27 14:14:56 1996  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* eval.c (scm_definedp): Incompatibly changed to be a builtin
 	Scheme function, instead of syntax. Single argument is now a
 	symbol.

Thu Nov 21 20:26:36 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* ramap.c (scm_ra_sum, scm_ra_difference, scm_ra_product,
	scm_ra_divide): Properly terminate statements passed as arguments
	to IVDEP macros.  (Thanks to Bernard Urban.)

	* eval.c (SCM_CEVAL): Use alloca, not GCC's extensions for arrays
	with non-constant sizes.  (Thanks to Bernard Urban.)

Thu Nov 21 11:17:42 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	It's an "eval closure", not an "eval thunk."  A thunk is a
	function of no arguments.
	* root.h (struct scm_root_state): Renamed
	top_level_lookup_closure_var from top_level_lookup_thunk_var.
	(scm_top_level_lookup_closure_var): Renamed from
	scm_top_level_lookup_thunk_var.
	* root.c (mark_root): Uses changed.
	* gdbint.c (gdb_eval, gdb_binding): Uses changed.
	* init.c (scm_start_stack): Uses changed.
	* eval.c (scm_eval, scm_eval_x, scm_init_eval): Rename uses.
	Change scheme-visible name to *top-level-lookup-closure* from
	*top-level-lookup-thunk*.

Tue Nov 19 22:43:31 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* gc.c (scm_igc, scm_gc_mark): Round up the size of the stack we
	pass to scm_mark_locations.  (Thanks to Aubrey Jaffer.)

Sun Nov 10 13:35:05 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* gc.c (struct scm_heap_seg_data): Doc fixes.

	* gc.c (scm_gc_sweep): Empty all segments' freelists before
	sweeping.  Then, prepend each segment's free cells to its
	freelist, rather than wiping out the old value.  (Thanks to Marius
	Vollmer.)

	* gc.c (which_seg, scm_map_free_list, scm_newcell_count,
	scm_check_freelist, scm_debug_newcell): New functions and
	variables, for debugging freelist problems.
	* pairs.h (SCM_NEWCELL): New debugging version added.
	* gc.h (scm_debug_newcell): Added extern declaration, used by
	debugging version of SCM_NEWCELL.

Sat Nov  9 19:02:46 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	On some systems <libc.h> conflicts with <unistd.h>, and should not
	be #included at all.
	* aclocal.m4 (GUILE_HEADER_LIBC_WITH_UNISTD): New autoconf macro.
	* acconfig.h (LIBC_H_WITH_UNISTD_H): New CPP symbol.
	* configure.in: Call it.
	* posix.c, filesys.c: Use its results to decide whether or not to
	#include <libc.h>.
	* configure, scmconfig.h.in: Rebuilt with autoconf and
	autoheader.

Wed Nov  6 16:19:50 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* fports.c (scm_stdio_to_port, scm_open_file): Set the port's
	pointer to the stdio stream before calling scm_setbuf0, so the
	latter will be able to retrieve it.  I'm surprised this didn't
	segfault earlier.  (Thanks to Christopher Lee.)

Wed Nov  6 16:01:20 1996  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* throw.c (scm_lazy_catch, scm_ithrow): Completed implementation
	of `lazy-catch'.

Sat Nov  2 21:01:48 1996  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* stacks.c, stacks.h (scm_make_stack): Now takes arbitrary
 	number of stack narrowing specifier pairs.  The first specifier in
 	a pair controls inner border, the second the outer border.  A
 	number means cut that number of frames, a procedure object means
 	cut until that object is found in operator position in a frame.

	* root.c (cwdr): Bugfix.

	* read.c: Recording of positions disabled by default.

	* procs.c (scm_closure_p): New function.

	* posix.c (scm_tmpnam): New function.

	* load.c: Added #include "throw.h".
	(scm_sys_search_load_path): Bugfix: Don't add an extra '/' if path
 	ends with '/'.
	
	* load.c, load.h (scm_read_and_eval_x): New function.

	* eval.c: Renamed debug option "deval" to "debug".
	
	(scm_eval_x): `eval!' is no longer accessible from the scheme
	level.  Motivation: We can't allow operations which introduce
	glocs into the scheme level.  Guile's type system can't handle
	these as data.  Use `eval' or `read-and-eval!' as replacement.
	
	* debug.c (scm_m_start_stack): Bugfix: Use SCM_ECONSP instead of
	SCM_CONSP since this is a macro!; Set vframe.prev to
	scm_last_debug_frame instead of 0.  In this way we can look
	"above" the virtual start stack frame if we wish.
	(scm_debug_hang): New function: Useful for debugging Guile in
	certain tricky situations.  Will probably be removed later...

	* debug.h: Changed semantics of debug option "backtrace".  This
	option now only indicates whether we want automatic backtrace at
	an error.
	
Wed Oct 30 00:31:55 1996  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* ports.c: #include "filesys.h"
	(scm_char_ready_p): input_waiting renamed and moved to filesys.c.

	* filesys.c, filesys.h (scm_input_waiting_p): Moved from ports.c.
  	Motivation: This is system specific code which is related to file
 	I/O.  It also may use select.  Added code by Gary Houston to
 	detect presence of character in stdio buffers.

	* libguile.h: #include "libguile/libpath.h"

	* Makefile.in (libpath.h): Renamed definition of: LIBRARY_PATH -->
 	SCM_LIBRARY_DIR; Added definitions of: SCM_PKGDATA_DIR,
 	SCM_SITE_DIR; Install libpath.h among the other include files.

	* load.c, load.h (scm_sys_package_data_dir): New function.

Mon Oct 28 11:43:41 1996  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* stacks.h: Bugfix: Don't use tail-array length field as stack
	length field!  This screwed GC.

Tue Oct 22 01:01:00 1996  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* _scm.h: Added #ifndef around definition of macros min and max.

	* __scm.h: Added hooks for threads to plugin to in ints protection
 	macros: SCM_THREAD_DEFER, SCM_THREAD_ALLOW, SCM_THREAD_REDEFER,
 	SCM_THREAD_ALLOW_1, SCM_THREAD_ALLOW_2.  Motivation: We don't want
 	the main code in these macros duplicated and spread over multiple
 	files. Renamed SCM_THREADS_SWITCHING_CODE ->
 	SCM_THREAD_SWITCHING_CODE.

Tue Oct 29 14:55:40 1996  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* snarf.h: New file.
	* guile-snarf.sh: New file.
	* Makefile.in (inner_h_files): Added snarf.h 
	(ancillary, install, uninstall, distclean): Added actions for
	guile-snarf.
	(.c.x): Use guile-snarf.
	(guile-snarf): New rule, to produce guile-snarf from guile-snarf.sh.
	(gen_c_files): Note that these depend on guile-snarf.
	* _scm.h: Removed the snarfing macros (SCM_PROC, etc). They are
 	now in "snarf.h".  Added #include "snarf.h" to get them.
	* libguile.h: Added #include "snarf.h".
	(Patches applied and tweaked by Jim Blandy.)
	
Tue Oct 29 13:21:13 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* socket.c: Use K&R style declaration for 'close'; the GNU coding
	standards suggest against providing prototypes for system
	functions.  Thanks to Greg Troxel. 

Mon Oct 28 16:48:32 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* strports.c (scm_eval_0str): New function.
	#include "read.h", to get prototype for scm_read.
	* Makefile.in (strports.o): Update dependencies.
	* strports.h: New prototype.

	* numbers.c (scm_integer_p): Renamed from scm_int_p; change its
	scheme name from "int?" to "integer?".  It seems to do the job.
	* numbers.h: Rename prototype too.
	* scmhob.h (intp): Change definition to refer to scm_integer_p.  I
	hope this is right.

	* numbers.c (scm_less_p, scm_gr_p, scm_leq_p, scm_geq_p,
	scm_num_eq_p): Rename these according to R4RS conventions: call
	them <, <=, =, >, and >=, not <?, <=?, =?, >?, and >=?.  En route
	to making libguile R4RS compliant without ice-9...

	* load.c (scm_sys_search_load_path): Search for files under all
	extensions listed in the %load-extensions variable.  If FILENAME
	is absolute, return it unchanged, without searching the load path.
	(scm_loc_load_extensions): New variable, pointing to
	%load-extensions' value cell.
	(scm_init_load): Initialize it, and the value it points to.
	(scm_primitive_load_path): Improve error reporting.

	* load.c (scm_loc_load_hook): New variable, pointing to value cell
	of new Scheme variable %load-hook.
	(scm_primitive_load): Apply %load-hook to filename.

Mon Oct 28 06:28:28 1996  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* configure.in: add tests for figuring out whether buffered data
 	is available in a FILE structure, which is needed by char-ready.
	
	* acconfig.h: define FILE_CNT_FIELD, FILE_CNT_GPTR and 
	FILE_CNT_READPTR.

	* simpos.c (scm_getenv): renamed from scm_sys_getenv.  Throw
	exceptions using misc_error instead of syserror.  It seems a bit
	odd to throw an exception if a string can't be found in the
	environment, but it's consistent with open-file, stat etc.
	(simpos.h): remove sys_ from getenv.

	* posix.c (scm_putenv): renamed from scm_sys_putenv.  If an error
	occurs, throw an error instead of returning errno.  Return value
	is now unspecified.
	(numerous in posix.c and posix.h): removed superfluous sys_ from names.

Sun Oct 27 01:22:04 1996  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* filesys.c (scm_stat2scm): derive file type and permissions from
 	the stat mode and append them to the returned vector.
	There isn't much overhead in doing this and it avoids the need to
	work with S_IRUSR et al. in Scheme.
	Define symbols scm_sym_regular etc.
	(scm_init_filesys): don't intern S_IRUSR etc.
	
	* load.c: change s_try_load and s_try_load_path to s_primitive_load
	and s_primitive_load_path.

	* eval.c, load.c, error.c (scm_wta): use scm_misc_error.

	* error.h: don't declare error symbols.  prototype for scm_misc_error.

	* stackchk.c (scm_stack_overflow_key): defined here instead of in
	error.c.

	* error.c: use SCM_SYMBOL to set up error keys.
	scm_misc_error: new procedure.

Fri Oct 25 01:56:30 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* read.c (scm_lreadr): Recognize SCSH-style block comments; text
	between `#!' and `!#' is ignored.
	(skip_scsh_block_comment): New function.

	* feature.c (scm_set_program_arguments): New argument, FIRST.
	* feature.h: Update prototype.
	* init.c (scm_boot_guile_1): Pass new argument to
	scm_set_program_arguments.

Tue Oct 22 20:54:42 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* init.c (scm_start_stack): Don't initialize scm_progargs here.
	(scm_boot_guile): Call scm_set_program_arguments here, later than
	the old initialization.

	* init.c: (scm_boot_guile, scm_boot_guile_1):  New, simplified
	initialization procedure.
	- Delete in, out, err arguments; there are other perfectly good
 	ways to override these when desired.
	- Delete result argument; this function shouldn't ever return.
	- Rename init_func argument to main_func, for less confusion.
	- Delete boot_cmd argument; main_func is more general.
  	-Add 'closure' argument, to help people pass data to main_func
 	without resorting to global variables.
	- Abort if reentered; don't bother returning an error code.
	- Call scm_init_standard_ports to set up the default/current
 	standard ports; no need to pass them to scm_start_stack.
	- Remove code to evaluate the boot_cmd, and start the repl; let
 	the user do something like that in main_func if they want.
	- Remove code to package up a return value; main_func can do any
 	of that as needed.
	- Call exit (0), instead of returning.
	(scm_start_stack): Don't initialize the I/O ports here; that's
 	weird.  Delete in, out, err arguments.  Move guts to
	scm_init_standard_ports, scm_stdio_to_port.
	(scm_init_standard_ports): New function, to set up current and
	default standard ports.
	(scm_start_stack, scm_restart_stack): Make these static.
	* init.h (scm_boot_guile): Adjust declaration.
	(scm_start_stack, scm_restart_stack): Remove externally
	visible declarations for these.
	(enum scm_boot_status): Removed; now scm_boot_guile never returns.
	
	* fports.c (scm_stdio_to_port): New function.  Its guts used to be
	written out several times in scm_start_stack.
	* fports.h: New declaration for the above.
	
	* feature.c (scm_set_program_arguments): New function.
	* feature.h: New declaration for the above.

	* ports.c: Formatting tweak.

Sun Oct 20 03:29:32 1996  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@kenneth>

	* pairs.h, eval.c, eval.h, feature.c, gc.c, list.c, load.c,
 	ramap.c, symbols.c: Added new selectors SCM_CARLOC and SCM_CDRLOC
 	for obtaining the address of a car or cdr field.  Motivation:
 	&SCM_CXR make assumptions about the internal structure of the
 	SCM_CXR selectors.

	* eval.h, eval.c: Added new selector SCM_GLOC_VAL_LOC.
  	Motivation: see SCM_CXRLOC.

	* pairs.h, eval.c, gc.c, init.c, ioext.c, ports.c, ports.h,
 	srcprop.h, tags.h, throw.c, unif.c: Added new selectors
 	SCM_SETAND_CAR, SCM_SETAND_CDR, SCM_SETOR_CAR and SCM_SETOR_CDR.
  	Motivation: Safer use.  Some other macros are defined in terms of
 	these operations.  If these are defined using the SCM_SETCXR
 	(<e1>, SCM_CXR (<e1>) <op> <e2>) pattern a complex <e1> will lead
 	to inefficiency and an <e1> with side-effects could potentially
 	break.  Also, these particular operations are heavily utilized in
 	the garbage collector.  In unoptimized code there will be a
 	measurable speedup.

	* alist.c, arbiters.c, continuations.c, debug.c, debug.h, eval.c,
 	eval.h, feature.c, filesys.c, fports.c, gc.c, gsubr.c, init.c,
 	ioext.c, kw.c, list.c, load.c, mallocs.c, numbers.c, numbers.h,
 	pairs.c, pairs.h, ports.c, ports.h, posix.c, procprop.c, procs.c,
 	procs.h, ramap.c, read.c, root.c, srcprop.c, srcprop.h,
 	strports.c, symbols.c, tags.h, throw.c, unif.c, variable.c,
 	vports.c: Cleaned up use of pairs: Don't make any special
 	assumptions about the internal structure of selectors and
 	mutators: SCM_CXR (<e1>) = <e2> --> SCM_SETCXR (<e1>, <e2>),
 	SCM_CXR (<e1>) &= <e2> --> SCM_SETAND_CXR (<e1>, <e2>) etc.
	(Among other things, this change makes it easier to build Guile
 	with certain compilers which have problems with casted lvalues.)
	
Fri Oct 18 01:11:56 1996  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* stacks.c: Improve selection of relevant stack frames when making
 	a stack object.  Introduce one level of indirection in the stack
 	object to make it possible to "narrow" to a certain region of the
 	stack.  This facilitates making use of more clever algorithms (not
 	implemented) for selecting relevant frames and gives a cleaner
 	design since selection of frames can be done independently of
 	extraction of frames from the real stack.
	(scm_stack_id): Also take #t as argument which means look at
	current stack.

	* stacks.h: In struct scm_stack: Turn field frames into a pointer.
	Turn n_tail into an integer directly representing current number
	of frames in stack.  Add field tail.

	* ports.c (scm_port_line_x, scm_port_column_x): New mutators.

	* debug.c (scm_make_memoized): Made it available at scheme level.
	(scm_unmemoize, scm_memoized_environment): Bugfix: Check for
	SCM_NIMP before applying heavier predicates in argument checking.
	(scm_local_eval): Also take memoized object as argument.
	
	* backtrace.c (scm_display_error): Just a safety measure: Stacks
	aren't created with zero length, but should such a strange
	creature suddenly turn up...

Wed Oct 16 11:08:41 1996  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* hashtab.h (scm_hashx_remove_x): Renamed `delete' parameter to
 	`del', for the sake of C++ compilers.  (Patch applied by JimB.)

Tue Oct 15 17:06:13 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* variable.c (scm_make_variable): Make the name hint optional, as
 	documented.
	(anonymous_variable_sym): Renamed from variable_sym.  All uses
 	changed.

	* load.c (scm_primitive_load, scm_primitive_load_path): Renamed
 	from scm_sys_try_load and scm_sys_try_load_path.  The Scheme name
 	of scm_primitive_load_path was also changed to
 	"primitive-load-path", from "%try-load-path".  Callers changed.
	We'd like to respect the convention that a function named
 	"try-mumble" should behave just like the function called "mumble",
 	but return #f instead of signalling some error.
	* load.h: Rename prototypes.

Tue Oct 15 05:34:10 1996  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@woody.nada.kth.se>

	* print.c (make_print_state, grow_print_state), print.h: Modified
 	the print state representation: Don't use a tail array for
 	recording of circular references.  Resizing of the print state
 	structure invalidates the print state pointer.  To avoid passing
 	around an indirect print state reference to all printing
 	functions, we instead let the print state reference a resizable
	vector.

Mon Oct 14 19:25:00 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* alist.c (scm_sloppy_assq, scm_sloppy_assv, scm_sloppy_assoc):
	Don't crash when passed an improper list terminated by a
	non-immediate value.

Mon Oct 14 19:08:33 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	Allocate data for structures on an eight-byte boundary, as
	required by the tagging system.
	* struct.c (alloc_struct): New function.
	(scm_make_struct, scm_make_vtable_vtable): Call it.
	* struct.h (scm_struct_n_extra_words): Bump to 3.
	(scm_struct_i_ptr): New "field".
	* gc.c (scm_gc_sweep): When we need to free the data, use the
 	information stored by alloc_struct to find the beginning of the
 	block allocated to the structure, so we can free it.

Mon Oct 14 17:07:55 1996  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@woody.nada.kth.se>

	* init.c (scm_boot_guile_1): Moved scm_init_struct in front of
	scm_init_stacks.

	* debug.h (SCM_VOIDFRAME, SCM_VOIDFRAMEP): New macros.
	(scm_debug_info): New member: id.

	* stacks.c: Stacks are now represented as structs; Stacks have an
 	id given to them by `start-stack'.
	(scm_last_stack_frame): Added predicates `stack?' and `frame?'.

	* stacks.h: Added declarations of scm_stack_p and scm_frame_p;
	Changed stack representation.

	* debug.c (scm_procedure_name): Try procedure property `name' for
	compiled closures aswell.

	* gc.c (scm_init_storage): Initialize scm_stand_in_procs to SCM_EOL.

	* eval.c: scm_i_name moved to gsubr.c
	(scm_m_define): Record names of all kinds of procedure
	objects.  (Earlier, only closures were recorded.)

	* procprop.h: Added declaration of scm_i_name.

	* gsubr.c: Added global scm_i_name.  Added #include "procprop.h".
	(scm_make_gsubr): Record names of compiled closures.
	
Mon Oct 14 04:21:51 1996  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@woody.nada.kth.se>

	* debug.c, debug.h: Removed obsolete code.

	* continuations.c, continuations.h, debug.c, gc.c, init.c, root.c,
	stacks.c: Renamed regs --> scm_contregs.

	* print.c (scm_free_print_state): Cleanup print state before
	returning it to pool.  It is better to do it here than in
	scm_prin1 since scm_prin1 is called often.

	* srcprop.c (scm_source_properties, scm_set_source_properties_x,
 	s_set_source_property_x): Check that first argument is a pair or a
	memoized object.

	* srcprop.c, srcprop.h: Made scm_i_filename, scm_i_copy,
	scm_i_line, scm_i_column and scm_i_breakpoint global.

	* init.c: Added #include "backtrace.h" and #include "stacks.h".
	(scm_boot_guile_1): Added calls to scm_init_backtrace and
	scm_init_stacks.

	* debug.h: Added debug object smob declaration and macro
	definitions.

	* configure.in: Build with backtrace.o and stacks.o if debug
	support enabled.

	* Makefile.in: Added entries for new files: backtrace.c,
	backtrace.h, stacks.c and stacks.h.

	* symbols.c (scm_sym2ovcell): Fixed documentation.

	* _scm.h (min, max): Added.

	* async.c: Moved `min' macro to _scm.h.

	* debug.h: New debug options SCM_BACKTRACE_MAXDEPTH and
	SCM_BACKTRACE_INDENT.

	* eval.c: Added new debug options `maxdepth' and `indent'.

	* print.c (make_print_state): Bugfix: Initialize pstate->ceiling.

	* print.h: Added selector SCM_PRINT_STATE.

	* print.c: New functions: scm_make_print_state,
 	scm_free_print_state.

	* print.h: Added declarations for scm_make_print_state,
 	scm_free_print_state.
	
	* debug.c (scm_m_start_stack): New acro.

	* debug.h: Small cleanup.

	* init.c (scm_boot_guile_1): Moved scm_init_debug below
	scm_init_eval.

Sun Oct 13 20:14:53 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	declare functions with prototypes.  (Patch thanks to Marius
	Vollmer.)

	More prototype-related changes from Marius Vollmer:
	* gdb_interface.h: Wrapped header file in #ifdef/#endif
	* gscm.h (gscm_run_scm): Added prototype for `initfn' paramter.
	* ports.h (ptobfuns): Added prototypes. This means some casting in
        fports.c.
	* fports.c: Added casts for initializations, since the functions
	are defined to take FILE * as their stream argument, not SCM.
	* fdsocket.c, fdsocket.h: Made `init_addr_buffer' static.
	* genio.c (scm_gen_puts): Changed `unsigned char *str_data' parameter
        to `char *str_data' to conform to prototype.

Sat Oct 12 21:49:29 1996  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* error.c, eval.c, load.c, stackchk.c: use scm_error not lgh_error.

	* __scm.h (lgh_error): removed, lgh shouldn't be in libguile.

	* stime.c, stime.h: use SCM_P method.
	
Sat Oct 12 16:16:25 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* eval.c (scm_nconc2last): Don't accept an empty list; apply must
 	be given at least two arguments.  Insist that lst's last element
 	be a list, but don't make any requirements of its predecessors.

Fri Oct 11 03:58:25 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* eval.c (scm_nconc2last): Revert last change; there seems to be
	other stuff going on here.

Fri Oct 11 02:43:59 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* eval.c (scm_nconc2last): Make sure that each element of lst
	(which is a list of argument lists, except for the tail) is a
	proper list, i.e., finite and terminated by '().

Thu Oct 10 21:09:13 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* unif.c (scm_ra_set_contp): Localize `inc' declaration.
	Clarifies flow.

	* struct.c (scm_make_struct, scm_make_vtable_vtable): Use the
	symbolic name for the tag, scm_tc3_cons_gloc, instead of just
	saying "1".

	* vectors.c (scm_make_vector): Fill vectors with the undefined
 	value, to help make Guile Scheme code more portable to other
 	Schemes.

	* symbols.c (scm_intern_obarray_soft, scm_sysintern): Doc fixes.
	* symbols.h, tags.h: Doc fixes.
	
Wed Oct  9 19:39:29 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* async.c (scm_take_signal): Doc fixes.

Mon Oct  7 22:30:34 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* numbers.c (scm_divbigint): When the remainder is zero, we don't
	want to subtract it from the modulus; we just want to leave it
	alone.

Mon Oct  7 00:14:17 1996  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@kenneth>

	* init.c (scm_boot_guile_1): Bugfix: i --> base in argument to
	`scm_init_threads'.

	* throw.h (scm_catch_apply): Removed the `lazyp' argument.

	* throw.c (scm_catch_apply): Finished implementation of
	`lazy-catch'.

Sun Oct  6 05:26:05 1996  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* filesys.c (scm_sys_select): move SCM_ALLOW_INTS past the sreturn
	check.
	(scm_init_filesys): set "i/o-extensions" feature.
	include feature.h.
	
Sat Oct  5 12:22:00 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (root.o): Correct dependencies.

Sat Oct  5 18:40:42 1996  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@kenneth>

	* Makefile.in: Added dependency entry for root.o.

	* continuations.c, debug.[ch], eval.c, gscm.c init.c, root.c,
	throw.c: Renamed last_debug_info_frame -> scm_last_debug_frame.

	* init.c (scm_start_stack): Set initial root continuation number
	to 0.

	* procs.c: New function: scm_thunk_p.

	* procs.h: Added declarations of scm_thunk_p.

	* root.c: Renamed `call-with-new-root' -->
	`call-with-dynamic-root'.
	(cwdr): Removed allocation of new root state.  This should be done
	separately by use of scm_make_root.
	(scm_apply_with_dynamic_root): New function: Does what it
	sounds like.  Needed when spawning threads.

	* root.h: Added member last_debug_frame to root state.
	Added #include "libguile/debug.h"

	* throw.c: Renamed scm_catch --> scm_catch_apply and added more
	arguments.  The motivation is that code in root.c needs catch
	functionality, and we want to avoid code duplication.
	New functions: scm_catch, scm_lazy_catch.  These are wrappers for
	scm_catch_apply.  scm_lazy_catch is intended to introduce catch
	handlers that run without popping the stack into the dynwind
	chain.

	* throw.h: Added prototypes for scm_catch_apply and
	scm_lazy_catch.

Thu Oct  3 11:12:33 1996  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@woody.nada.kth.se>

	* root.h (scm_root, scm_set_root): Decouple thread support details
 	by introducing the selector SCM_THREAD_LOCAL_DATA and the mutator
 	SCM_SET_THREAD_LOCAL_DATA.

	* print.c (scm_iprlist): Bugfix: Added SCM_ECONSP tests in hare
	and tortoise scanning loop.

Thu Oct  3 00:04:53 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in: Rebuild dependencies.

	* libguile.h: #include "libguile/print.h" before "smob.h", since
	the latter uses the print_state structure.

	* throw.c (scm_ithrow): Use the correct variable when checking to
	see if a given element of scm_dynwinds is a valid catch.

	* throw.c (scm_ithrow): If scm_dynwinds has invalid list
 	structure, abort; don't just silently ignore the garbage.

	* _scm.h: #include "print.h" here, since it seems to be used just
	about everywhere.
	* eval.c, gdbint.c, genio.h, numbers.h, smob.h, srcprop.c,
	strports.c, unif.h: Don't #include "print.h".

Tue Oct  1 05:15:10 1996  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@woody.nada.kth.se>
	
	* feature.h (scm_loc_features): Removed external declaration.
	(Bug fix suggested by Petr Adamek <adamek@mit.edu>.)

Tue Oct  1 00:00:10 1996  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@woody.nada.kth.se>

	* feature.c (scm_init_feature): Added threads feature (needs to be
 	initialized here, since features doesn't exist when
 	scm_init_threads is called).

	* libguile.h: Added #include "libguile/../threads/threads.h".
	(This is a kludge to get thread support working.  This should be
	fixed.)

	* configure.in, acconfig.h: Added flags for thread support.

	* scmsigs.c: Define `signal' to be `pthread_signal' if using
 	mit-pthreads.

	* gc.c (scm_igc): Added SCM_THREAD_CRITICAL_SECTION_START and
 	SCM_THREAD_CRITICAL_SECTION_END.  Moved marking of root data to
	root.c:mark_root.

	* _scm.h: Added conditional #include "threads.h"

	* __scm.h (SCM_ASYNC_TICK): Added call to macro
 	SCM_THREADS_SWITCHING_CODE.

	* init.c (scm_start_stack): Call `scm_make_root' to dynamically
 	allocate the basic dynamic root object.
	(scm_boot_guile): Added call to scm_init_root.

	* root.c, root.h: Added root smob.
	(cwdr, scm_call_with_new_root, scm_dynamic_root, scm_app_wdr): New
 	functions: Implements dynamic roots mostly according to spec in
 	SCM manual.  Main difference is that the second argument is a
	throw handler rather than an error "thunk".

	* root.h: Added declaration of scm_init_root.

	* root.c: Added #include "genio.h", #include "smob.h", #include
 	"pairs.h", #include "throw.h", #include "dynwind.h", #include
 	"eval.h"
	(scm_init_root): Added #include "root.x".

	* throw.c: Added #include "stackchk.h"
	(scm_catch): Changed SCM_DEFER_INTS --> SCM_REDEFER_INTS and
 	SCM_ALLOW_INTS --> SCM_REALLOW_INTS.  This is so that scm_catch
 	can be used in scm_call_with_new_root; Added reenabling of stack
 	checking when catching a throw.

Mon Sep 30 21:48:11 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* list.c, list.h: Use SCM_P instead of CPP hair.  Doc fixes.

	* list.c (scm_member, scm_memv, scm_memq): Return #f if a matching
	element is not found, as per R4RS.

Sat Sep 28 18:13:01 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* list.c: Doc fixes throughout.

Sat Sep 28 02:07:43 1996  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* strings.c, strings.h: (scm_makfrom0str, scm_makefrom0str_opt:
	declare the char * to be const.  Avoids a warning in rgx.c.

	* ports.h: spelling fix.

	* filesys.c (scm_sys_stat, scm_sys,lstat): include file name in
	error messages.

	* load.c (scm_sys_try_load_path): throw an error if file not found
	(like it says it in NEWS).

Fri Sep 27 18:27:01 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* symbols.c (scm_intern_obarray_soft): Initialize the new symbol's
	PROPS slot to '(), not #f; it's an empty alist.

	* throw.h, throw.c: Use SCM_P instead of #if hair.

	Remove special support for uncaught throws; see throw.c for
	rationale. 
	* throw.c (uncaught_throw): New function.
	(scm_ithrow): Call uncaught_throw if we don't find a throw
	target; don't mess with scm_bad_throw_vcell.
	(scm_bad_throw_vcell): Variable deleted.
	(scm_init_throw): Don't initialize it.

	* throw.c (scm_ithrow): Don't let outer key matches shadow inner
	#t catches.

Wed Sep 25 04:35:50 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* numbers.c (scm_istr2int): If the number is short (as most
	numbers are), just call scm_small_istr2int to deal with it.
	(scm_small_istr2int): New function, created by un-#ifdefing the
	non-bignum version of scm_istr2int and renaming it.

Tue Sep 24 06:48:38 1996  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* load.c (scm_sys_try_load): don't check whether value returned
	by scm_open_file is #f, it won't be.  Always return SCM_UNSPECIFIED.
	Change the Scheme name from %try-load to primitive-load.

	* error.c (scm_error): convert a NULL message to SCM_BOOL_F.
  	Can avoid passing a message, allowing it to be derived in the
 	error handler (e.g., if we want to throw to the key both from
 	Scheme and C).

Mon Sep 23 00:42:15 1996  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@kenneth>

	* print.c (scm_iprin1, scm_prin1, scm_iprlist): Circular
 	references now have a new appearance which is more compact and
	also gives a clue about what the target of the reference is.
	By setting parameters in the print state, more fancy printing can
	be achieved.  This is used by the (not yet commited) backtrace
	code.

Sun Sep 22 17:10:06 1996  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@kenneth>

	* eval.c, numbers.h, unif.h, smob.h, srcprop.c: Added #include
 	"print.h"
	
	* print.c: Added #include "struct.h".  Removed function
	scm_prlist.

	* print.h: Modified prototypes for scm_iprlist, scm_prin1 and
 	scm_iprin1.  Removed prototype for scm_prlist.
	
	* arbiters.c (prinarb),
	async.c (print_async),
	debug.c (prindebugobj, prinmemoized),
	eval.c (prinprom, prinmacro),
	filesys.c (scm_fd_print, scm_dir_print),
	kw.c (print_kw),
	mallocs.c (prinmalloc),
	numbers.c, numbers.h (scm_floprint, scm_bigprint),
	smob.h (scm_smobfuns),
	srcprop.c (prinsrcprops),
	throw.c (prinjb),
	unif.c, unif.h (scm_raprin1, rapr1),
	variable.c (prin_var): Changed argument `int writing' to
	`scm_print_state *pstate'.

	* init.c (scm_boot_guile): Moved scm_init_struct upwards so
	that it will be called before scm_init_print.

	* print.c (scm_prin1): Print states are now allocated when calling
 	scm_prin1 and then passed around to all printing functions as an
 	argument.  A cache `print_state_pool' enables reuse of print
 	states.
	(scm_make_print_state): New function.
	(scm_iprin1): Adaption to print states.
	(scm_iprlist): An initial "hare and tortoise" scan brings down
	time complexity to O (depth * N).  (Better time complexity will be
	achieved when the printing code is completely rewritten.)
	
Fri Sep 20 22:01:36 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* aclocal.m4 (GUILE_STRUCT_UTIMBUF): Use AC_CACHE_CHECK instead of
	AC_CACHE_VAL; #define UTIMBUF_NEEDS_POSIX outside AC_CACHE_VAL, so
	it gets done whether or not the cache variable has a value.

Thu Sep 19 17:06:39 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	Distinguish #f and ().
	* __scm.h: #undef SICP.
	* pairs.h (SCM_EOL): Delete this definition, equating it with
	SCM_BOOL_F.
	* tags.h (SCM_EOL): Give it a new definition here; I think I found
	the value it used to have.  Doc fixes, too.

Thu Sep 19 15:33:51 1996  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@kenneth>

	* struct.c (scm_make_struct_layout, init_struct, scm_struct_ref,
 	scm_struct_set_x), struct.h, gc.c (scm_gc_mark): Completed Tom
 	Lord's implementation of structs, allowing for tail arrays as
 	described in the manual. Also fixed some bugs. (Both the interface
 	and the implementation should be improved.)

	* read.c (scm_init_read): Removed #ifdef READER_EXTENSIONS

	* print.c, print.h: Closures now print like #<procedure foo (x)>.
	People who whish to see the source can do `(print-enable 'source)'.
	Removed #ifdef DEBUG_EXTENSIONS.
	
Thu Sep 19 00:00:29 1996  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* filesys.c (scsm_sys_stat): don't SIGSEGV if argument is an
	integer (assuming for now accepting an integer is a good thing).

	%S will be used instead for write'ing arguments.

	* unif.c (scm_transpose_array): change arguments in the SCM_WNA
	asserts.  fix a few other asserts.

	scm_dimensions_to_unform_array): change args in
	SCM_WNA SCM_ASSERTS and change scm_wta's to scm_wrong_num_args.
	strop.c (scm_substring_move_left_x, scm_substring_move_right_x,
	scm_substring_fill_x): likewise.
	gsubr.c (scm_gsubr_apply): likewise.
	eval.c (SCM_APPLY): likewise.

	* eval.c (4 places): replace scm_everr with lgh_error or
 	scm_wrong_num_args.

	* error.c, error.h (scm_wrong_num_args, scm_wrong_type_arg,
	scm_memory_error): new procedures.
	scm_everr: deleted.  can use scm_wta, dropping first two args.
	scm_error: convert NULL subr to SCM_BOOL_F.

	* __scm.h: don't define SCM_STACK_OVFLOW, SCM_EXIT, SCM_ARG6, SCM_ARG7,
	SCM_ARGERR.

	* stackchk.c (scm_report_stack_overflow): use lgh_error instead
	of scm_wta.

	* error.c, error.h: new error keys: scm_arg_type_key,
	scm_args_number_key, scm_memory_alloc_key, scm_stack_overflow_key,
	scm_misc_error_key.
	scm_wta: reimplement using lgh_error instead of scm_everr.

Wed Sep 18 17:13:35 1996  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@kenneth>

	* gdbint.c: scm_lread now has one more argument.

	* ports.c, ports.h: Name change: scm_\(line\|column\)_number -->
 	scm_port_\1; Added mutator scm_set_port_filename_x (used when
 	loading source from non-file ports, which, e. g., happens when
 	using the Emacs interface).

	* fports.c (scm_open_file): Don't call scm_makfrom0str on a scheme
 	object.

	* read.c: Added code for recording of positions of source code
 	expressions; New functions: recsexpr, scm_lreadrecparen;
 	_scm_make_srcprops --> scm_make_srcprops
	(scm_flush_ws): Removed updating of positions counters.  This work
 	is already done by scm_gen_getc

 	--> scm_make_srcprops

	* srcprop.h: Name changes: tc16_srcprops --> scm_tc16_srcprops,
 	_scm_make_srcprops --> scm_make_srcprops; Remove one layer of
 	function calls in the definition of the whash access macros.

Tue Sep 17 11:33:16 1996  Lee Iverson  <leei@Canada.AI.SRI.COM>

	* init.c (scm_boot_guile): Add level of indirection to
 	scm_boot_guile_1() to ensure that stack base pointer is properly
 	initialized.  There was no guarantee that variable i was the
 	highest/lowest variable on stack (i.e. the call frame of
 	scm_boot_guile was not completely protected from gc).

Tue Sep 17 01:40:56 1996  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* ports.h (scm_port_table): put back file_name, it will be used to
 	support debugging.  Undo related changes in fports.c, ioext.c,
	ports.c, gc.c.

Sun Sep 15 03:58:29 1996  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* ports.h (scm_port_table): remove file_name member for now, it seems
	undesirable.

	(prinfport): don't use file_name in PTAB.
	* ioext.c (scm_sys_duplicate_port): don't set file_name in PTAB.

	(scm_port_file_name): remove for now.
	* gc.c (scm_gc_mark): don't mark PTAB file_name.

	* fports.h (scm_mkfile): prototype deleted.
	* fports.c (scm_mkfile): merged into scm_open_file to simplify.

	* debug.c, unif.c: use scm_out_of_range instead of
	wta for range errors (ASSERT still needs work).

	* error.c, error.h (scm_out_of_range): new procedure.

	* error.c, error.h (scm_out_of_range_key): new key.

	* posix.c (scm_sync): #else was missing.

	* error.c, error.h: append _key to names scm_num_overflow and
 	scm_system_error.

	* __scm.h (SCM_SYSMISSING, SCM_NUM_OVERFLOW): use SCM_BOOL_F instead
	of consing an empty list.
	(SCM_SYSERROR etc.): move into error.c, make them procedures instead
	of macros, saves code and string space.
	error.c, fports.c, numbers.c, posix.c, ioext.c, filesys.c, socket.c,
	fdsocket.c, simpos.c: change names of SCM_SYSERROR etc., to
	lower case.  Rename scm_syserror_m to scm_syserror_msg.
	error.h: prototypes for new procedures.

Sat Sep 14 03:35:41 1996  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* numbers.c: use SCM_NUM_OVERFLOW instead of scm_wta or ASSERT.

	* error.c, error.h: setup scm_num_overflow key.

	* __scm.h: SCM_NUM_OVERFLOW: macro for reporting numerical overflow.
	Remove definition of SCM_OVSCM_FLOW.

	* fports.c (scm_open_file): use SCM_SYSERROR_M.

	* __scm.h: SCM_SYSERROR_M: new macro for system errors with an
	explicit message and args.

	* error.c, error.h, __scm.h: change system_error_sym to
	scm_system_error.

	* error.c (system_error_sym): remove leading %% from the Scheme name
	"%%system-error". 

	* __scm.h (SCM_SYSMISSING): Redefine using lgh_error.

Fri Sep 13 12:58:08 1996  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@woody.nada.kth.se>

	* __scm.h, chars.c, debug.c, eval.c, eval.h, extchrs.c, extchrs.h,
 	fdsocket.c, feature.c, mbstrings.c, mbstrings.h, numbers.c,
 	numbers.h, print.c, scmhob.h, simpos.h, symbols.c, symbols.h,
 	tags.h, throw.c, variable.h: Name cleanup.  Lots of xxxSCM_yyy
 	renamed.  (These were introduced by unsupervised name
 	substitution.)

Fri Sep 13 01:19:08 1996  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@woody.nada.kth.se>

	* print.c: Added code for detection of circular references during
 	printing.  (init_ref_stack, grow_ref_stack): New functions.  Added
 	a hook for printing of closures (accessible via print options).
  	This leads to a split of calls to scm_iprin1 into two classes:
 	elementary print operations (e. g. the code which prints a smob)
 	still use scm_iprin1 while top level calls (like scm_display) use
	scm_prin1.  scm_prin1 begins by clearing the data structure used
	to record reference information.

	* print.h: Added declarations of scm_prin1 and scm_prlist.

	* strports.c (scm_strprint_obj): scm_iprin1 --> scm_prin1

	* gscm.c (gscm_portprint_obj): scm_iprin1 --> scm_prin1

	* gscm.h (gscm_print_obj): scm_iprin1 --> scm_prin1

	* error.c (err_head): scm_iprin1 --> scm_prin1

	* debug.c: Adjusted header comment.

	* tags.h: Typo.

Wed Sep 11 17:55:59 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* strerror.c: Doc fix.

Thu Sep 12 00:00:32 1996  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@woody.nada.kth.se>

	* gdbint.c (gdb_read): Now possible to run during GC.
	(unmark_port, remark_port): New functions.

	* symbols.h (SCM_SETLENGTH): Use SCM_SETCAR.

	* read.c (scm_grow_tok_buf): Use scm_vector_set_length_x instead
	of allocating a new string object.  Also, increase size by
	the factor 2 instead of 1.5.

Wed Sep 11 15:10:38 1996  Petr Adamek  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* __scm.h (SCM_P): Corrected to run under traditional C.

	* _scm.h (SCM_PROC): Extraneous semicolon (outside functions)
	removed.

	* async.c: Calls to scm_sysintern corrected.

	* async.h (scm_async_clock): Redundant declaration removed.

	* continuations.c (scm_dynthrow): Redundant declaration removed.

	* debug.c (scm_single_step, scm_memoized, scm_lookup_soft):
	Definition typos corrected.

	* debug.h: Missing declarations of functions in debug.c added
	(lots).

	* eval.h (scm_eval_args, scm_deval_args, scm_m_undefine):
	Missing declarations to functions in eval.c added.

	* filesys.c: Possibly uninitialized variable rv.

	* gc.h (scm_object_addr, scm_unhash_name): Missing
	declarations of functions defined in gc.c added.

	* genio.c: Possible typos str_data -> wstr_data. ???

	* genio.c: Possibly unintended shadowing of local variable
	`int c' (gotos out of scope of inner `c'). ???

	* init.c: Uninitialized `SCM last' may be used.

	* ioext.h: (scm_sys_isatty_p): Typo.

	* list.h (scm_list_head): Missing prototype for function in
	list.c added.

	* numbers.c (scm_two_doubles): Changed from extern to static
	(is used only within numbers.c).

	* numbers.h: Repeated declarations removed.

	* ports.h (scm_close_all_ports_except): Declaration for the
	function defined in ports.c added.

	* posix.h: Missing declarations added.

	* procs.h (scm_make_subr_opt): Missing declaration added.

	* socket.h (scm_sys_gethost): Missing declaration added.

	* socket.h: Redundant declarations removed (they are in fdsocket.h).

	* srcprop.h (scm_set_source_property_x, scm_finish_srcprop):
	Missing declarations added.

	* stime.h (scm_get_internal_real_time): Repeated declarations removed.

	* struct.c: Uninitialized variable `SCM answer' may be used.

	* unif.c (l2ra): Declaration prototype.

	* unif.c (scm_array_equal_p): Dummy definition removed (it is
	defined in ramap.c).

	* unif.h (scm_raprin1, scm_istr2bve, scm_array_equal_p):
	Redundant declarations removed (they are in ramap.h).

	* variable.h (scm_make_udvariable,
	scm_make_undefined_variable): Declaration corrected to
	correspond variable.c.

	* vectors.h (scm_vector_move_left_x, scm_vector_move_right_x):
	Missing declarations added.

Wed Sep 11 14:38:50 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (distclean): Don't forget to delete fd.h.

Tue Sep 10 14:01:46 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* fd.h.in, tags.h: Trivial cleanups. 

	* marksweep.c, marksweep.h: Deleted; marksweep.c was empty, and
	marksweep.h just declared functions from gc.c.
	* gc.h, libguile.h: Don't #include "marksweep.h".
	* Makefile.in (libobjs, inner_h_files, c_files, gen_c_files): Omit
	marksweep.o, marksweep.h, marksweep.c, and marksweep.x.  Other
	dependencies updated.

	* libguile.h: Don't #include "files.h"; it's been deleted.

	* files.c (scm_sys_delete_file): Moved to filesys.c.
	File is now empty; deleted.
	* files.h: Deleted.
	* filesys.c: scm_sys_delete_file is now here.  Remove
	#if's; they seem to rely on remnants of an old portability
	regimen.  If the problems come up again, solve them properly,
	using autoconf.  Specifically: Don't test M_SYSV, and #define
	remove to be unlink if it's #defined; don't use remove just
	because HAVE_STDC_HEADERS is #defined.
	* filesys.h: Add declarations for scm_sys_delete_file.
	* Makefile.in (libobjs, inner_h_files, c_files, gen_c_files): Omit
	files.o, files.h, files.c, and files.x.
	* init.c: Don't #include "files.h", and don't call scm_init_files.

	Use SCM_P instead of PROTO; the latter intrudes on the user's
	namespace.
	* params.h: Deleted; definition of SCM_P moved to...
	* __scm.h: ... here, where it replaces PROTO macro.
	* libguile.h, smob.h: Don't #include "params.h".
	* continuations.c, error.h, feature.h, gc.c, gc.h, init.h, load.h,
	smob.h: Fix prototypes accordingly.
	* Makefile.in: Update dependencies.
	(inner_h_files): Remove params.h.

	* gc.c: #include "gc.h"; every module should include its header,
	to let the compiler cross-check the declarations against the
	definitions.

	* eq.h, files.h, hashtab.h, load.h, mallocs.h, scmsigs.h,
	simpos.h: #include "libguile/__scm.h".

Mon Sep  9 20:00:15 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* init.c: Don't forget to #include smob.h and init.h.
	* Makefile.in: Dependencies updated.

	* smob.h: Use PROTO instead of #if __STDC__.

	* continuations.c (scm_dynthrow): Use PROTO, not SCM_P. 

	* __scm.h: Doc fixes.

	* __scm.h, libguile.h: Use "quotes" in the #includes, not
	<angles>; this allows `make depends' to work properly.

	* libguile.h: #include smob.h and pairs.h before the others; they
	define typedefs used by other headers.
	
	C files should #include only the header files they need, not
	libguile.h (which #includes all the header files); the pointless
	recompilation was wasting my time.
	* Makefile.in (all .o dependency lists): Regenerated.
	* libguile.h: Don't try to get a definition for size_t here...
	* __scm.h: Do it here.
	* _scm.h: Since this is the internal libguile header, put things
 	here that all (or a majority) of the libguile files will want.
  	Don't #include <libguile.h> here; that generates dependencies on
 	way too much.  Instead, get "__scm.h", "error.h", "pairs.h",

	* smob.h: #include "ports.h", "genio.h", and "print.h", since
	anyone who uses this file will need them to define the smob
	printing functions.  Also, get markers.h, since people will need
	to #define the mark functions.
	
	* smob.h (scm_ptobfuns, SCM_PTOBNUM): Definitions moved...
	* ports.h: ... to here.

	* ports.h (scm_port_table_size): Explicitly give type as 'int';
	don't rely on archaic C default type rules.

	* fports.h: #include "libguile/ports.h", since you need that in
	order to parse this.

	* genio.h: #include "libguile/print.h", because you need that to
	parse this; don't bother #including "ports.h", since print.h gets
	that.
	
	* error.h: Don't #include "pairs.h"; _scm.h will do that now.
	
	* eval.h (scm_top_level_lookup_thunk_var): Remove declaration for
	this; it's now a reference to an element of *scm_root.

	* debug.h: Don't #include "options.h"; the compiler won't be able
	to find that once the headers are installed; instead, #include
	"libguile/options.h".
	* gc.h: Same, with marksweep.h.
	* mbstrings.h: Same, with symbols.h.
	* scmhob.h: Same, with _scm.h.
	* smob.h: Same, with params.h.
	
	* Makefile.in (depends): Don't nuke scmconfig.h and the generated
	C files; there's no need for this, and it forces recompilations
	unnecessarily.

Sat Sep  7 06:57:23 1996  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* error.c (scm_error): declare scm_error_callback.

	* error.h: prototype for scm_error_callback.

	* __scm.h: define lgh_error.
 	(SCM_SYSERROR): redefine using lgh_error.

Thu Sep  5 22:40:06 1996  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* error.c (scm_error): new procedure.

	* error.h: prototype for scm_error.

	* Makefile.in (install): install scmconfig.h from the current
	directory, not $(srcdir).

Thu Sep  5 11:38:07 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* alist.h, append.h, arbiters.h, async.h, boolean.h, chars.h,
 	continuations.h, debug.h, dynwind.h, error.h, eval.h, fdsocket.h,
 	feature.h, filesys.h, fports.h, gc.h, gdbint.h, genio.h, gsubr.h,
 	hash.h, init.h, ioext.h, kw.h, list.h, markers.h, marksweep.h,
 	mbstrings.h, numbers.h, objprop.h, options.h, pairs.h, ports.h,
 	posix.h, print.h, procprop.h, procs.h, ramap.h, read.h, root.h,
 	sequences.h, smob.h, socket.h, srcprop.h, stackchk.h, stime.h,
 	strings.h, strop.h, strorder.h, strports.h, struct.h, symbols.h,
 	tag.h, throw.h, unif.h, variable.h, vectors.h, version.h,
 	vports.h, weaks.h: #include "libguile/__scm.h", not
	<libguile/__scm.h>.  This allows 'gcc -MM' to determine which
	dependencies are within libguile properly.

Thu Sep  5 11:38:07 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (.c.x): Simplify; there's no need to run this rule
	when scmconfig.h doesn't exist. 

	* load.c (scm_sys_try_load): Correct spelling.

	* feature.c (scm_loc_features): Make this static.

	* Makefile.in (libpath.h): Omit trailing slash from path.  We
	shouldn't require it of users, so why put it here?

	Move code to initialize and search %load-path from ice-9 to C
	code, so we can use the load-path to find the ice-9 boot code;
	this makes it easier to run Guile without installing it.  See
	corresponding changes in guile/Makefile.in.
	* feature.c: Move stuff concerned with the load path to load.c.
	(scm_compiled_library_path): Deleted.
	Don't #include libpath.h here.
	* feature.h: Don't mention scm_compiled_library_path.
	* load.c: #include "libpath.h" here, as well as <sys/types.h>,
	<sys/stat.h>, and <unistd.h> (if present).
	(R_OK): #define if the system hasn't deigned to.
	(scm_loc_load_path): New variable.
	(scm_init_load_path, scm_sys_search_load_path,
	scm_sys_try_load_path): New functions.
	(scm_init_load): Initialize scm_loc_load_path to point to the
	value cell of the Scheme %load-path variable.
	* load.h: Add declarations for scm_sys_search_load_path,
 	scm_sys_try_load_path.
	* init.c: Call scm_init_load_path.
	* Makefile.in (feature.o, load.o): Dependencies updated.

	* load.c, load.h: Rewrite using PROTO macro.
	
Thu Sep  5 01:54:33 1996  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@woody.nada.kth.se>

	* gc.c (scm_cellp): New function: C predicate to determine if an
	SCM value can be regarded as a pointer to a cell on the heap.

	* gc.h: Added declaration of scm_cellp.

	* gdb_interface.h: New file: The GDB interface header from the GDB
	distribution.

	* gdbint.c: New file: GDB interface.

	* gdbint.h: New file: GDB interface.

	* libguile.h: Added #include <libguile/gdbint.h>.

	* init.c (scm_boot_guile): Added scm_init_gdbint.

	* Makefile.in: Added gdb_interface.h, gdbint.[hc].
	Added -I.. to INCLUDE_CFLAGS (otherwise the include files won't be
	found if object files and source are kept separate).

Wed Sep  4 14:35:02 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* feature.h, feature.c: Use PROTO macro, instead of #if __STDC__.

Wed Sep  4 01:30:47 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in: Don't substitute the values of TCL_SRC_DIR and
	TK_SRC_DIR; they're not relevant any more.

	* Makefile.in (CC): Don't list -Wall here; it's a GCC-specific flag.
	* configure.in: Instead, put it in CFLAGS here, iff we're using GCC.

Wed Sep  4 00:55:49 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* PLUGIN/guile.config (xtra_cflags): Include .. in the header
	search path, so we can find the <libguile/MUMBLE.h> headers.

	* Makefile.in (ancillary): List aclocal.m4, for 'make dist'.

	* Makefile.in (ALL_CFLAGS): Don't mention CFLAGS here; it's
	implicit in the .c.o rule.
	(.c.x): Don't mention ALL_CFLAGS here; its value is included in
	$(CC) already.

	Put the library path in a header file, instead of passing it on
	the command line in every compilation.
	* Makefile.in (libpath.h): New target.
	(feature.o): Depend on libpath.h.
	(clean): Delete libpath.h.
	(ALL_CFLAGS): Don't use -DLIBRARY_PATH here.  Instead ...
	* feature.c: ... #include "libpath.h" here.
	* .cvsignore: Ignore libpath.h.

	Don't install the unwashed masses of Guile header files in the
	main #include path; put most of them in a subdirectory called
	'libguile'.  This avoids naming conflicts between Guile header
	files and system header files (of which there were a few).
	* Makefile.in (pkgincludedir): Deleted.
	(innerincludedir): New variable; this and $(includedir) are enough. 
	(INCLUDE_CFLAGS): Search for headers in "-I$(srcdir)/..".
	(installed_h_files): Divide this up.  Now this variable lists
	those header files which should go into $(includedir) (i.e. appear
	directly in the #include path), and ...
	(inner_h_files): ... this new variable says which files appear in
	a subdirectory, and are referred to as <libguile/mumble.h>.
	(h_files): List them both.
	(install): Create innerincludedir, not pkgincludedir.  Put
	the installed_h_files and inner_h_files in their proper places.
	(uninstall): Corresponding changes.
	* alist.h, append.h, arbiters.h, async.h, boolean.h, chars.h,
	continuations.h, debug.h, dynwind.h, error.h, eval.h, fdsocket.h,
	feature.h, fports.h, gc.h, genio.h, gsubr.h, hash.h, init.h,
	ioext.h, kw.h, libguile.h, list.h, markers.h, marksweep.h,
	mbstrings.h, numbers.h, options.h, pairs.h, ports.h, posix.h,
	print.h, procprop.h, procs.h, ramap.h, read.h, root.h,
	sequences.h, smob.h, socket.h, srcprop.h, stackchk.h, stime.h,
	strings.h, strop.h, strorder.h, strports.h, struct.h, symbols.h,
	tag.h, throw.h, unif.h, variable.h, vectors.h, version.h,
	vports.h, weaks.h: Find __scm.h in its new location.
	* __scm.h: Find scmconfig.h and tags.h in their new locations
	(they're both "inner" files).

Tue Sep  3 20:27:35 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (.c.x): Remove duplicate use of $(ALL_CFLAGS).

Tue Sep  3 19:53:00 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* posix.c: Doc fixes.

Mon Sep  2 15:22:40 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* socket.c: Don't include a prototype for inet_aton; just use a
 	K&R style declaration, to avoid warnings but minimize the chance
 	of conflicts with the system.

	On NextStep, <utime.h> doesn't define struct utime, unless we
	#define _POSIX_SOURCE before #including it.
	* aclocal.m4 (GUILE_STRUCT_UTIMBUF): New test.
	* acconfig.h: New comment text for above CPP symbol.
	* configure.in: Call it.
	* posix.c: #define _POSIX_SOURCE if it seems necessary.

	* configure.in (AC_CHECK_HEADERS): Include sys/utime.h and utime.h
	in the list.
	* posix.c: Check HAVE_SYS_UTIME_H and HAVE_UTIME_H, instead of
	testing for __EMX__.

	* posix.c: #include <libc.h>, if it exists.

	* posix.c: Cast the return result to GETGROUPS_T, not gid_t; we
	don't even know if the latter exists.

        * posix.c (s_sys_setpgid, s_sys_setsid, s_sys_ctermid,
	s_sys_tcgetpgrp, s_sys_tcsetpgrp): Renamed from s_setpgid,
	s_setsid, s_ctermid, s_tcgetpgrp, s_tcsetpgrp, for consistency.

	* posix.c (R_OK, W_OK, X_OK, F_OK): #define these if the system's
	header files don't.
	(scm_init_posix): Use them when initializing the Scheme constants
	of the same name.

Fri Aug 30 16:01:30 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (libdir, includedir, bindir): Use the
	autoconf-supplied values, instead of deriving them ourselves.
	(pkgincludedir, datadir, pkgdatadir): New variables.
	(install, uninstall): Put the header files in a special
	subdirectory, not in the main search path.

	* Makefile.in (ALL_CFLAGS): Provide the proper value for
	LIBRARY_PATH --- use $(pkgdatadir) instead of $(libdir). 

	* Makefile.in (IMPLPATH): Deleted; never used.
	
	* Makefile.in (TCL_SRC_DIR, TK_SRC_DIR): Deleted; we don't depend
	on the Tcl/Tk source any more.
	(INCLUDE_CFLAGS): Remove references to the above.

	* Makefile.in (version.o): Corrected dependencies.

Thu Aug 29 23:06:19 1996  Thomas Morgan  <tmorgan@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* libguile.h: #include "version.h"

	* init.c (scm_boot_guile): Call scm_init_version.
	* gscm.c (gscm_run_scm): Call scm_init_version.

	* configure.in (GUILE_MAJOR_VERSION, GUILE_MINOR_VERSION,
	GUILE_VERSION): AC_DEFINE these.
	(acconfig.h): #undef the above symbols.

	* Makefile.in (libobjs): Add version.o.
	(installed_h_files): Add version.h.
	(c_files): Add version.c.
	(gen_c_files): Add version.x.
	(version.o): New rule.
	(alist.o, append.o, appinit.o, arbiters.o, async.o, boolean.o,
	chars.o, continuations.o, dynwind.o, eq.o, error.o, eval.o,
	fdsocket.o, feature.o, files.o, filesys.o, fports.o, gc.o,
	genio.o, gsubr.o, hash.o, hashtab.o, init.o, kw.o, list.o, load.o,
	mallocs.o, markers.o, marksweep.o, mbstrings.o, numbers.o,
	objprop.o, pairs.o, ports.o, posix.o, print.o, procprop.o,
	procs.o, ramap.o, read.o, root.o, scmsigs.o, sequences.o,
	simpos.o, smob.o, socket.o, stackchk.o, stime.o, strings.o,
	strop.o, strorder.o, strports.o, struct.o, symbols.o, tag.o,
	throw.o, unif.o, variable.o, vectors.o, version.o, vports.o,
	weaks.o): Add version.h to dependency lists.
	(markers.o): Remove duplicate rule.

	* version.h: New file.

	* version.c: New file.

Thu Aug 29 15:21:39 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* symbols.c (scm_strhash): scm_downcase is now a function, not an
 	array; use it appropriately.  Since GCC is quite happy to
 	subscript functions, it never warned us about this; we should use
 	-Wpointer-arith in the future.  I guess we never tested
 	case-insensitivity.

Wed Aug 28 18:52:22 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* socket.c: Doc and copyright fixes.

Sat Aug 24 05:29:19 1996  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@woody.nada.kth.se>

	* debug.c: Fixed and improved gdb support.

Fri Aug 23 18:00:16 1996  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@woody.nada.kth.se>

	* socket.c: Added declaration of inet_aton to avoid compiler
 	warning.  (Hope this solution is correct.)

	* stime.c: Added declaration of ftime.  (This is missing in
	Solaris 2 headers.)

Fri Aug 23 02:03:32 1996  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* configure, scmconfig.h.in: Updated, using autoconf and autoheader.

	* Makefile.in (c_files): add strerror.c.

	* strerror.c: new file from Emacs' sysdep.c.
	maybe configure should also check for sys_errlist.

	* configure.in (AC_REPLACE_FUNCS): add strerror.

Fri Aug 23 03:02:46 1996  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@woody.nada.kth.se>

	* debug.c (scm_init_debug): Added initialization for
	scm_evaluator_traps.

	* debug.h, debug.c: Various name changes.
	(Mostly prefixing with SCM_.)  Renamed "debug-options" -->
	"debug-options-interface".  See commentary in options.c.

	* options.h, options.c: Options now have documentation strings.
	Also added a long explanatory commentary.
	
	* eval.c, print.h, print.c, read.h, read.c: Modifications to
	run-time options.

	* gscm.c, init.c, root.c, throw.c: Bug fixes:
	last_debug_info_frame is now updated in all cases.

	* __scm.h, stackchk.h, stackchk.c: Guile now performs stack
	checking.

Thu Aug 22 17:34:17 1996  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@woody.nada.kth.se>

	* __scm.h: SCM_STACK_LIMIT removed (now a run-time option).
	Added option STACK_CHECKING.

Tue Aug 20 18:48:40 1996  Mikael Djurfeldt  <djurfeldt@nada.kth.se>

	* Makefile.in: Added {debug,options,srcprop}.{h,c}
	
	* __scm.h: Removed symbols for debugging support.

	* acconfig.h: Added symbols for debugging support.

	* configure.in: Added user option for debugging support.
	--enable-debug will include the debugging code into libguile.a.

	* continuations.c (scm_make_cont): Enlarged the #if 0 around
	scm_relocate_chunk_to_heap.
	
	* debug.c: New file: low-level debugging support.  It also
 	includes support for debugging with gdb.  (The extensions to gdb
 	are written by Per Bothner at Cygnus.)

	* debug.h: New file: low-level debugging support.

	* eval.c: scm_m_set and SCM_IM_SET no longer supports multiple
 	argument pairs.  Extensive modifications to the debugging
 	evaluator.  Added "SECTION:" commentaries to clarify what happens
 	when, during double compilation.  Renamed EVALIMP --> EVALIM.
  	Renamed EVAL --> XEVAL.  Removed function evalcar.  Defined
 	evalcar to scm_eval_car.  Added explanation of "EVAL" symbols to
 	the beginning of the file.  New procedure: scm_unmemocopy.
	Added some global state variables needed by the debugging
	evaluator: scm_ceval_ptr, last_debug_info_frame, debug_mode,
	check_entry, check_apply, check_exit, debug_options and
	evaluator_traps.  New acro: undefine.
	
	* eval.h: Renamed EVAL --> XEVAL.

	* gc.c (scm_init_storage): Renamed scm_make_weak_hash_table
	--> scm_make_weak_key_hash_table.
	
	* init.c (scm_restart_stack, scm_boot_guile): Added initialization
	of SCM_DFRAME.  Added calls to scm_init_{debug,options,srcprop}.
	
	* libguile.h: Conditionally include debug.h

	* objprop.c (scm_object_properties, scm_set_object_properties_x):
 	scm_object_properties shouldn't return handle.  `handle' now gets
 	initialized in scm_set_object_properties_x.  scm_object_properties
	doesn't any longer create an entry in scm_object_whash.
	
	* options.c: New file: handling of run time options.
	
	* options.h: New file: handling of run time options.

	* posix.c (scm_getpgrp): Cast pointer to getpgrp.
	
	* print.c: New procedure: scm_print_options

	* print.h: Defines for print options.
	
	* read.c: New procedure: scm_read_options

	* read.h: Defines for reader options.
	
	* root.h: Added scm_source_whash among scm_sys_protects.

	* srcprop.c: New file: source properties.
	
	* srcprop.h: New file: source properties.
	
	* throw.c (jbsmob): Jump buffers are now correctly allocated.
	(Bug found by A. Green.)

	* weak.c: Renamed scm_weak_hash_table --> scm_weak_key_hash_table.
	
	* weak.h: Renamed scm_weak_hash_table --> scm_weak_key_hash_table.

Thu Aug 15 02:05:14 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* libguile.h: #include "objprop.h"; I guess this was forgotten.

	* init.c (scm_boot_guile): Don't call scm_init_rgx; it's a plugin,
	and should be called by the final client.

Wed Aug 14 21:41:37 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* gc.h: Use the PROTO macro when declaring functions.
	* gc.c: Use the PROTO macro when declaring static functions.
  	Remove the CPP hair around function definitions.

	* gc.c (scm_init_storage): Initialize scm_asyncs.

	* libguile.h: #include "__scm.h" before testing the STDC_HEADERS
	preprocessor symbol; "__scm.h" is where it might get #defined.
	* __scm.h: Similar: #include <scmconfig.h> before testing
	HAVE_LIMITS_H.

	* __scm.h: It's HAVE_LIMITS_H, not HAVE_LIMITSH.
	
Fri Aug  9 11:09:28 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* init.c (scm_boot_guile): Add init_func argument; call
	(*init_func) instead of calling scm_appinit; it's ucky to
	hard-code names for the user's procedures.
	* init.h (scm_boot_guile): Adjust declaration.

	* __scm.h (PROTO): New macro, for declaring functions with
	prototypes.

	* init.h (scm_start_stack, scm_restart_stack): Use PROTO;
	eliminate all the __STDC__ conditionals.
	(scm_boot_guile): Add declaration.
	* init.c (scm_start_stack, scm_restart_stack, scm_boot_guile):
	Remove __STDC__ conditionals around function definitions; the
	declarations in init.h will provide the same information, more
	usefully.

	* __scm.h (SCM_SYSMISSING): When we don't have ENOSYS, don't
	complain about it in the error message; the error message is
	adequate without that note, and there's nothing the user can do
	about it.

Wed Aug  7 14:14:46 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (ancillary): Drop def.sed.

	* posix.c (scm_init_posix): Use numeric values, rather than
	CPP symbols, when defining the scheme values R_OK, W_OK, X_OK, and
	F_OK.  The symbols aren't available on some systems, and I'm
	pretty sure their values are fixed by common widespread practice.
	* ioext.c (scm_init_ioext): Code here defined them too; remove it.

	More functions unavailable on some systems.
	* configure.in (AC_CHECK_FUNCS): Add ctermid, setpgid, setsid,
	tcgetpgrp, tcsetpgrp, and waitpid to the list of functions to
	check for.
	* configure, scmconfig.h.in: Updated, using autoconf and autoheader.
	* posix.c (scm_sys_ctermid, scm_sys_setpgid, scm_sys_setsid,
	scm_sys_tcgetpgrp, scm_sys_tcsetpgrp, scm_sys_waitpid): Put the
	bodies of these functions in "#ifdef HAVE_MUMBLE" clauses, with a
	stub that signals an error as the #else.

	* Makefile.in (ancillary): Drop acconfig-1.5.h; add acconfig.h.

Wed Aug  7 06:28:42 1996  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* Fixes motivated by Petr Adamek <adamek@mit.edu>:

	* unif.c: include ramap.h.

	* read.c (endif): case_insensative_p renamed case_insensitive_p.

	* ramap.h: rename scm_array_copy prototypes to scm_array_copy_x.

	* ports.c: include sys/ioctl.h.

	* scmconfig.h.in: add HAVE_SYS_IOCTL_H.

	* configure.in: check for sys/ioctl.h.

	* ports.c: include <malloc.h> not "malloc.h".

	* mallocs.c: include <malloc.h> not "malloc.h", likewise for unistd.h.

	* fports.c: remove ttyname and tmpnam declarations.

	* posix.c: fewer ttyname declarations.

	* fports.c: include <string.h> not "string.h".

	* init.c, ioext.c: include string.h and unistd.h.

	* gc.c: include <malloc.h> not "malloc.h", likewise for unistd.h.

	* async.c, strings.h, strports.c, struct.c, symbols.c, feature.c,
	genio.c, simpos.c, vports.c: include string.h.

	* socket.c, fdsocket.c: include string.h only if HAVE_STRING_H.

	* fdsocket.c (getsockopt, setsockopt): change type of optlen from 
	scm_sizet to int.
	(scm_addr_buffer_size): change type from scm_sizet to int.
	(accept, getsockname, getpeername, recvfrom): change type of tmp_size
	from scm_sizet to int.

	* error.c: include unistd.h.

	* __scm.h: (SCM_SYSMISSING): another version in case ENOSYS isn't
	defined.

	* Makefile.in: remove references to .hd, .cd suffix and __scm.hd.

	* __scm.hd, def.sed: deleted.

Tue Aug  6 14:49:08 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	Changes for NeXT, suggested by Robert Brown.
	* configure.in: Call AC_TYPE_MODE_T.
 	(AC_CHECK_HEADERS): Add libc.h, to get more prototypes on the
 	NeXT.  Put header file list in alphabetical order.
	* configure, scmconfig.h.in: Regenerated.
	* filesys.c [HAVE_LIBC_H]: #include <libc.h>.

	* filesys.c [HAVE_STRING_H]: #include <string.h>, to get prototype
	for strerror.
	
	* acconfig.h: New file, providing documentation for the CPP
	symbols defined in configure.in
	* acconfig-1.5.h: Removed; superceded by the above.

Sat Aug  3 01:27:14 1996  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* ioext.c (scm_sys_fdopen): fix the port-table assignment.

	* fports.c (scm_open_file): don't return #f, throw error.

	* ioext.c (fileno): renamed from %fileno.
	(soft-fileno): deleted.

	* ports.c (scm_port_revealed): don't need to check for -1 from

	The weird symbol syntax is also a bit bogus (emacs doesn't quite
	cope).
