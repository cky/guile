/* FETCH_STORE sets "fet" to the value fetched from "mem" and then stores
   "sto" there.  The fetch and store are done atomically, so once the fetch
   has been done no other thread or processor can fetch from there before
   the store is done.

   The operands are scm_t_bits, fet and sto are plain variables, mem is a
   memory location (ie. an lvalue).

   ENHANCE-ME: Add more cpu-specifics.  glibc atomicity.h has some of the
   sort of thing required.  FETCH_STORE could become some sort of
   compare-and-store if that better suited what various cpus do.  */

/* This is for i386 with the normal 32-bit scm_t_bits.  The xchg instruction
   is atomic on a single processor, and it automatically asserts the "lock"
   bus signal so it's atomic on a multi-processor (no need for the lock
   prefix on the instruction).

   The mem operand is read-write but "+" is not used since old gcc
   (eg. 2.7.2) doesn't support that.  "1" for the mem input doesn't work
   (eg. gcc 3.3) when mem is a pointer dereference like current usage below.
   Having mem as a plain input should be ok though.  It tells gcc the value
   is live, but as an "m" gcc won't fetch it itself (though that would be
   harmless).  */
