/* Getting into and out of guile mode.

/* Ken Raeburn observes that the implementation of suspend and resume
   (and the things that build on top of them) are very likely not
   correct (see below).  We will need fix this eventually, and that's
   why scm_leave_guile/scm_enter_guile are not exported in the API.

   Ken writes:

   Consider this sequence:

   Function foo, called in Guile mode, calls suspend (maybe indirectly
   through scm_leave_guile), which does this:

      // record top of stack for the GC
      t->top = SCM_STACK_PTR (&t);     // just takes address of automatic
      var 't'
      // save registers.
      SCM_FLUSH_REGISTER_WINDOWS;      // sparc only
      setjmp (t->regs);                // here's most of the magic

   ... and returns.

   Function foo has a SCM value X, a handle on a non-immediate object, in
   a caller-saved register R, and it's the only reference to the object
   currently.

   The compiler wants to use R in suspend, so it pushes the current
   value, X, into a stack slot which will be reloaded on exit from
   suspend; then it loads stuff into R and goes about its business.  The
   setjmp call saves (some of) the current registers, including R, which
   no longer contains X.  (This isn't a problem for a normal
   setjmp/longjmp situation, where longjmp would be called before
   setjmp's caller returns; the old value for X would be loaded back from
   the stack after the longjmp, before the function returned.)

   So, suspend returns, loading X back into R (and invalidating the jump
   buffer) in the process.  The caller foo then goes off and calls a
   bunch of other functions out of Guile mode, occasionally storing X on
   the stack again, but, say, much deeper on the stack than suspend's
   stack frame went, and the stack slot where suspend had written X has
   long since been overwritten with other values.

   Okay, nothing actively broken so far.  Now, let garbage collection
   run, triggered by another thread.

   The thread calling foo is out of Guile mode at the time, so the
   garbage collector just scans a range of stack addresses.  Too bad that
   X isn't stored there.  So the pointed-to storage goes onto the free
   list, and I think you can see where things go from there.

   Is there anything I'm missing that'll prevent this scenario from
   happening?  I mean, aside from, "well, suspend and scm_leave_guile
   don't have many local variables, so they probably won't need to save
   any registers on most systems, so we hope everything will wind up in
   the jump buffer and we'll just get away with it"?

   (And, going the other direction, if scm_leave_guile and suspend push
   the stack pointer over onto a new page, and foo doesn't make further
   function calls and thus the stack pointer no longer includes that
   page, are we guaranteed that the kernel cannot release the now-unused
   stack page that contains the top-of-stack pointer we just saved?  I
   don't know if any OS actually does that.  If it does, we could get
   faults in garbage collection.)

   I don't think scm_without_guile has to have this problem, as it gets
   more control over the stack handling -- but it should call setjmp
   itself.  I'd probably try something like:

      // record top of stack for the GC
      t->top = SCM_STACK_PTR (&t);
      // save registers.
      SCM_FLUSH_REGISTER_WINDOWS;
      setjmp (t->regs);
      res = func(data);
      scm_enter_guile (t);

   ... though even that's making some assumptions about the stack
   ordering of local variables versus caller-saved registers.

   For something like scm_leave_guile to work, I don't think it can just
   rely on invalidated jump buffers.  A valid jump buffer, and a handle
   on the stack state at the point when the jump buffer was initialized,
   together, would work fine, but I think then we're talking about macros
   invoking setjmp in the caller's stack frame, and requiring that the
   caller of scm_leave_guile also call scm_enter_guile before returning,
   kind of like pthread_cleanup_push/pop calls that have to be paired up
   in a function.  (In fact, the pthread ones have to be paired up
   syntactically, as if they might expand to a compound statement
   incorporating the user's code, and invoking a compiler's
   exception-handling primitives.  Which might be something to think
   about for cases where Guile is used with C++ exceptions or
   pthread_cancel.)
