/* {Run-time options}
 *
 * This is the basic interface for low-level configuration of the
 * Guile library.  It is used for configuring the reader, evaluator,
 * printer and debugger.
 *
 * Motivation:
 *
 * 1. Altering option settings can have side effects.
 * 2. Option values can be stored in native format.
 *    (Important for efficiency in, e. g., the evaluator.)
 * 3. Doesn't use up name space.
 * 4. Options can be naturally grouped => ease of use.
 */

/* scm_options is the core of all options interface procedures.
 *
 * Some definitions:
 *
 * Run time options in Guile are arranged in groups.  Each group
 * affects a certain aspect of the behaviour of the library.
 *
 * An "options interface procedure" manages one group of options.  It
 * can be used to check or set options, or to get documentation for
 * all options of a group.  The options interface procedure is not
 * intended to be called directly by the user.  The user should
 * instead call
 *
 *   (<group>-options)
 *   (<group>-options 'help)
 *   (<group>-options 'full)
 *
 * to display current option settings (The second version also
 * displays documentation.  The third version also displays
 * information about programmer's options.), and
 *
 *   (<group>-enable  '<option-symbol>)
 *   (<group>-disable '<option-symbol>)
 *   (<group>-set! <option-symbol> <value>)
 *   (<group>-options <option setting>)
 *
 * to alter the state of an option  (The last version sets all
 * options according to <option setting>.) where <group> is the name
 * of the option group.
 *
 * An "option setting" represents the state of all low-level options
 * managed by one options interface procedure.  It is a list of
 * single symbols and symbols followed by a value.
 *
 * For boolean options, the presence of the symbol of that option in
 * the option setting indicates a true value.  If the symbol isn't a
 * member of the option setting this represents a false value.
 *
 * Other options are represented by a symbol followed by the value.
 *
 * If scm_options is called without arguments, the current option
 * setting is returned.  If the argument is an option setting, options
 * are altered and the old setting is returned.  If the argument isn't
 * a list, a list of sublists is returned, where each sublist contains
 * option name, value and documentation string.
