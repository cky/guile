/* {heap tuning parameters}
 *
 * These are parameters for controlling memory allocation.  The heap
 * is the area out of which scm_cons, and object headers are allocated.
 *
 * Each heap cell is 8 bytes on a 32 bit machine and 16 bytes on a
 * 64 bit machine.  The units of the _SIZE parameters are bytes.
 * Cons pairs and object headers occupy one heap cell.
 *
 * SCM_INIT_HEAP_SIZE is the initial size of heap.  If this much heap is
 * allocated initially the heap will grow by half its current size
 * each subsequent time more heap is needed.
 *
 * If SCM_INIT_HEAP_SIZE heap cannot be allocated initially, SCM_HEAP_SEG_SIZE
 * will be used, and the heap will grow by SCM_HEAP_SEG_SIZE when more
 * heap is needed.  SCM_HEAP_SEG_SIZE must fit into type size_t.  This code
 * is in scm_init_storage() and alloc_some_heap() in sys.c
 *
 * If SCM_INIT_HEAP_SIZE can be allocated initially, the heap will grow by
 * SCM_EXPHEAP(scm_heap_size) when more heap is needed.
 *
 * SCM_MIN_HEAP_SEG_SIZE is minimum size of heap to accept when more heap
 * is needed.
 */


/*
 * Heap size 45000 and 40% min yield gives quick startup and no extra
 * heap allocation.  Having higher values on min yield may lead to
 * large heaps, especially if code behaviour is varying its
 * maximum consumption between different freelists.
