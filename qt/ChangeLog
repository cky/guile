2001-11-21  Gary Houston  <ghouston@arglist.com>

	* Makefile.am (OMIT_DEPENDENCIES): removed, since it seems to be
	obsolete.  autogen.sh says:
	invalid unused variable name: `OMIT_DEPENDENCIES'

2001-11-04  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* md/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Added `i386.asm'.

	* md/i386.asm: New file.  Contains the Intel syntax version for
	nasm/tasm/masm of the file `i386.s'.

	* qt.h.in: Definition of QT_API, QT_IMPORT and QT_EXPORT.
	Prefixed each symbols which is meant to go into a DLL.

	* Makefile.am (libqthreads_la_LDFLAGS):  Put `-no-undefined' 
	into LDFLAGS to support linkers which do not allow unresolved 
	symbols inside shared libraries.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Add `libqthreads.def', which is an export file 
	definition for M$-Windows.  It defines exported symbols.  This is
	necessary because the M$VC linker does not know how to export
	assembler symbols into a DLL.

2001-08-25  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* Makefile.am, md/Makefile.am, time/Makefile.am:
	(AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS): Change "foreign" to "gnu".

2001-08-15  Rob Browning  <rlb@defaultvalue.org>

	* Makefile.am (libqthreads_la_LDFLAGS): use libtool interface version
	variables.

2000-06-12  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@thalamus.nada.kth.se>

	* Makefile.am (OMIT_DEPENDENCIES): Defined to contain the list of
	machine specific headers.  This is necessary, otherwise automake
	will include a dependency specific for the machine on which the
	distribution archive was built.

2000-04-21  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@thalamus.nada.kth.se>

	* *.*: Change includes so that they always use the "prefixes"
	libguile/, qt/, guile-readline/, or libltdl/.

	* Makefile.am (DEFS): Added.  automake adds -I options to DEFS,
	and we don't want that.
	(INCLUDES): Removed all -I options except for the root source
	directory and the root build directory.
	
1999-10-05  Jim Blandy  <jimb@savonarola.red-bean.com>

	* Makefile.in, md/Makefile.in, time/Makefile.in: Deleted from CVS
	repository.  Run the autogen.sh script to create generated files
	like this one.

1998-10-16  Jim Blandy  <jimb@zwingli.cygnus.com>

	* md/i386.s: Remove nested comment starter, to quiet warnings.

	* Makefile.am (.s.lo): Supply our own rule here, which passes
	qthread_asflags through.  See today's change to ../qthreads.m4.
	* Makefile.in, qt/Makefile.in, time/Makefile.in: Regenerated.

1998-10-03  Jim Blandy  <jimb@zwingli.cygnus.com>

	dependency generation right when using EGCS.

1998-09-29  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.red-bean.com>

	* stp.h (stp_create): Doc fix.

1998-07-30  Jim Blandy  <jimb@zwingli.cygnus.com>

1998-07-29  Jim Blandy  <jimb@zwingli.cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in, md/Makefile.in, time/Makefile.in: Regenerated using
	the last public version of automake, not the hacked Cygnus
	version.

1998-07-28  Jim Blandy  <jimb@zwingli.cygnus.com>

	* time/Makefile.in, md/Makefile.in, Makefile.in: Regenerated,
	after removing Totoro kludge.

1998-07-26  Jim Blandy  <jimb@zwingli.cygnus.com>

	Use libtool, and the thread configuration mechanism.
	* Makefile.am (lib_LTLIBRARIES, EXTRA_LTLIBRARIES,
	libqthreads_la_SOURCES, libqthreads_la_LIBADD): These replace
	lib_LIBRARIES, EXTRA_LIBRARIES, libqthreads_a_SOURCES,
	libqthreads_a_LIBADD.  Use the variables set by the new config
	system.
	(libqthreads_la_DEPENDENCIES): New var.
	(libqthreads_la_LDFLAGS): Add -rpath; automake claims it can't set
	it itself, but I don't completely understand why.
	(qtmds.o, qtmdc.o): Rules removed.  Use implicit build rules.
	(qtmds.s, qtmdc.c, qtdmdb.s): Rules added, to make symlinks to the
	appropriate files in the source tree.

1998-04-15  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@nada.kth.se>

1997-12-02  Tim Pierce  <twp@skepsis.com>

Sat Oct 25 02:54:11 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.red-bean.com>

	* Makefile.am: Call the library libqthreads.a, not libqt.a.  The
	old name conflicts with the Qt user interface toolkit.
	* Makefile.in: Regenerated.

Mon Sep 29 23:54:28 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.red-bean.com>

	* Makefile.in, md/Makefile.in, time/Makefile.in: Regenerated with
	automake 1.2a.

Thu Aug 28 23:49:19 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.red-bean.com>

	* Makefile.in, md/Makefile.in, time/Makefile.in: Regenerated.

Wed Aug 27 17:43:38 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.red-bean.com>

	* Makefile.in, md/Makefile.in, time/Makefile.in: Regenerated, so
 	it uses "tar", not "gtar".

	* config: Use the QuickThreads assembler fragment with Irix
 	dynamic linking support for Irix 6 as well as Irix 5.  Thanks to
 	Jesse Glick.

Wed Jul 23 20:32:42 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <djurf@zafir.e.kth.se>

	* md/axp.s, md/axp_b.s: Changed comments from C-style to # to
	please the alpha assembler.

Sun Jun 22 18:44:11 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.red-bean.com>

	* Makefile.in, md/Makefile.in, time/Makefile.in: Regenerated after
	timestamp change; see ../ChangeLog.

Wed Jun 11 00:33:10 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.red-bean.com>

	* Makefile.in, md/Makefile.in, time/Makefile.in: Regenerated after
	xtra_PLUGIN_guile_libs change in ../configure.in.

Tue May 13 16:40:06 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

Sun Apr 27 18:00:06 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* aclocal.m4: Removed; unnecessary, given changes of Apr 24.

Thu Apr 24 01:37:49 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	Get 'make dist' to work again.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Remove PLUGIN files.
	* Makefile.in: Regenerated, like the secret sachets of seven
	sultry sailors.

	Changes for reduced Guile distribution: one configure script,
	no plugins.
	* configure.in, configure: Removed.
	* Makefile.in, md/Makefile.in, time/Makefile.in: Regenerated.

Tue Apr 15 17:46:54 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* PLUGIN/OPT: Don't mention "threads", because that causes
	"threads" to appear in the list of directories to be configured.
	Just say enough to get qt to appear in the list.  I don't think qt
	needs to be built before or after anything else in particular...

Mon Feb 24 21:47:16 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* configure.in: Added AM_MAINTAINER_MODE

Sun Feb  9 15:20:59 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@kenneth>

	* configure.in: Added changequote(,) before the host case (since
	we use [ and ] in a pattern).
	* configure: Regenerated.

Fri Feb  7 18:00:07 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in: Recognize i686 as an okay processor too.
	* configure: Regenerated.

Mon Dec  9 17:55:59 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@duality.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	We need to name the object files produced from the
	machine-dependent C and assembler files qtmds.o and qtmdc.o, but
	using -c and -o together on the cc command line isn't portable.
	* configure.in: Generate the names of the .o files here, and
	substitute them into Makefile.
	* Makefile.am (qtmds.o, qtmdc.o): Let CC name them what it wants,
	and then rename them when it's done.
	(configure, Makefile.in): Regenerated.

Sat Nov 30 23:59:06 1996  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

	* PLUGIN/greet: Removed.
	* Makefile.am, md/Makefile.am, time/Makefile.am, aclocal.m4: New
	files.
	* configure.in: Updated for Automake.

Sun Nov 10 17:40:47 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in, Makefile.in: The 'install' and 'uninstall'
 	Makefile targets should be affected by whether or not we have a
 	port to the current target architecture too, not just the 'all'
 	target.

Wed Oct  9 19:40:13 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in: If we don't have a port to the current machine,
 	just arrange for 'make all' to do nothing.  Don't abort
 	configuration.  We need a fully configured directory tree in order
 	to make distributions and the like.

	* Makefile.in (distfiles): Update for the new directory structure.
	(plugin_distfiles, md_distfiles, time_distfiles): New variables.
	(dist-dir): New target; use all the above to build a subtree of a
	distribution.
	(manifest): Target deleted.

Tue Oct  1 02:06:19 1996  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@woody.nada.kth.se>

	* configure.in: Solaris 2 should use sparc.s.
	*Older* systems use _sparc.s

Fri Mar 29 11:50:20 1996  Anthony Green  <green@snuffle.cygnus.com>

	* configure: Rebuilt
	* Makefile.in, configure.in: Fixed installation.

Fri Mar 22 16:20:27 1996  Anthony Green  (green@gerbil.cygnus.com)

	* all files: installed qt-002 package. Autoconfiscated.
