2002-02-04  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	* primitives/syntax.scm (parse-formals, transform-lambda,
	interactive-spec, set-not-subr!, transform-lambda/interactive):
	Move into internals/lambda.scm so that these can also be used
	by...
	
	* internals/fset.scm (elisp-apply): Use `eval' and 
	`transform-lambda/interactive' to turn a quoted lambda expression
	into a Scheme procedure.

	* transform.scm (m-quasiquote): Don't quote `quasiquote' in
	transformed code.
	(transformer): Transform '() to #nil.

2002-02-03  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	* internals/Makefile.am (elisp_sources): Add lambda.scm.

	* internals/lambda.scm (lang): New file.

2002-02-01  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	* transform.scm (transformer), primitives/syntax.scm (let*):
	Unquote uses of `begin' in transformed code.

2002-01-29  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	* transform.scm (transform-1, transform-2, transform-3,
	transform-list): Removed (unused).
	
	* transform.scm, primitives/syntax.scm: Add commas everywhere
	before use of (guile) primitives in generated code, so that (lang
	elisp base) doesn't have to import bindings from (guile).
	
	* base.scm: Move use-modules expressions inside the define-module,
	and add #:pure so that we don't import bindings from (guile).

2002-01-25  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	* transform.scm (transform-application): Preserve source
	properties of original elisp expression by using cons-source.

	* transform.scm: Don't handle special forms specially in the
	translator.  Instead, define them as macros in ...
	
	* primitives/syntax.scm: New file; special form definitions.

	* primitives/fns.scm (run-hooks): Rewritten correctly.

	* primitives/symprop.scm (symbol-value): Use `value'.

	* internals/set.scm (value): New function.

	* primitives/fns.scm: Use (lang elisp internals null), as null is
	no longer a primitive.  Change generated #f values to %nil.

	* internals/null.scm (null): Handle nil symbol.

	* primitives/lists.scm (memq, member, assq, assoc): Handle all
	possible nil values.

	* transform.scm (transformer): Translate `nil' and `t' to #nil and
	#t.

	* base.scm: Remove setting of 'language read-option.

2001-11-03  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	* README (Resources): Fill in missing URLs.

2001-11-02  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	* Makefile.am (elisp_sources): Added base.scm, example.el,
	interface.scm; removed emacs.scm.

	* README: Updated accordingly.

	* internals/load.scm (load): Avoid using `load-path' if the
	supplied file name begins with a slash.
	
	* internals/fset.scm: Support export of defuns, defmacros and
	defvars to a module specified by the fluid `elisp-export-module'.
	This allows us to automate the importing of Elisp definitions into
	Scheme.
	
	* example.el: New file: example code for `load-elisp-file'.

	* interface.scm: New file - mechanisms to exchange definitions
	between Scheme and Elisp.

	Following changes try to make the Elisp evaluation module less
	Emacs-dependent; in other words, so that it isn't necessary to try
	to load the whole Emacs environment before evaluating basic
	non-Emacs-specific Elisp code.
	
	* variables.scm, internals/evaluation.scm: Changed (lang elisp
	emacs) to (lang elisp base).
	
	* emacs.scm (lang): Removed.

	* base.scm (lang): New file (non-emacs-specific replacement for
	emacs.scm).

2001-10-28  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	* primitives/symprop.scm (symbol-name): New primitive.

	* primitives/strings.scm (stringp): New primitive.

	* primitives/pure.scm (purify-flag): New variable.

	* primitives/numbers.scm (numberp): New primitive.

	* internals/fset.scm (fset): Set procedure and macro name
	properties usefully to match Elisp symbol names.  Also bind Elisp
	function definition variables to similarly named symbols in the
	(lang elisp variables) module.

	* transform.scm (transformer, m-unwind-protect): Added support for
	`unwind-protect'.
	(m-quasiquote): Use 'quasiquote rather than 'quote.
	(transform-lambda, m-defmacro): When no rest arguments, set the
	rest parameter to '() rather than #f.  It shouldn't make any
	difference, but it feels more right.

	* README: Enlarged description of current status.

	* Makefile.am (elisp_sources): Added variables.scm.

	* variables.scm: New file.

2001-10-26  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	* buffers.scm, calling.scm: Removed.  These should have
	disappeared during the reorganization described below, but I
	missed them by mistake.
	
	* primitives/symprop.scm (set, boundp, symbol-value): Changed to
	use (module-xx the-elisp-module ...) rather than (local-xx ...).
	(symbolp): Accept either symbols or keywords.
	(set-default, default-boundp, default-value,
	local-variable-if-set-p): New.

	* primitives/match.scm (string-match, match-data): Store last
	match data in Emacs rather than Guile form, to simplify
	implementation of ...
	(set-match-data, store-match-data): New.

	* primitives/load.scm (autoload, current-load-list): New.  (But
	autoload is just stubbed, not properly implemented.)

	* primitives/lists.scm (nth, listp, consp, nconc): New.

	* primitives/fns.scm (byte-code-function-p, run-hooks): New.

	* transform.scm (transform-application, transformer-macro): New
	scheme for transforming procedure arguments while leaving macro
	args untransformed.  (See also associated change in libguile.)
	(m-defconst): Simplified, now uses m-setq.

	* Makefile.am: Changed so that it only deals with files directly
	in this directory; otherwise files don't install cleanly.

	* internals/Makefile.am, primitives/Makefile.am,
	internals/.cvsignore, primitives/.cvsignore: New files.

2001-10-26  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	* transform.scm (transformer): New handling for (1) quasiquoting
	syntax like "(` ...)" as well as the more normal "` ..."; (2)
	`function'; (3) interactive specification in lambda body.
	Simplied handling for `setq'.
	(transform-inside-qq): Fixed to handle improper as well as proper
	lists.
	(transform-lambda/interactive): New; wraps transform-lambda to
	handle setting of various procedure properties.
	(transform-lambda, m-defmacro): Changed `args' and `num-args' to
	`%--args' and `%--num-args' in the hope of avoiding lexical
	vs. dynamic name clashes.
	(m-and): Use #f instead of '() where a condition fails.

	Plus big hierarchy reorganization, in which most of the previous
	occupants of lang/elisp moved to lang/elisp/primitives, with some
	internal processing being split out into lang/elisp/internals.
	The upshot looks like this:

	* internals/trace.scm, internals/set.scm, internals/load.scm,
	internals/fset.scm, internals/signal.scm, internals/time.scm,
	internals/format.scm, internals/null.scm,
	internals/evaluation.scm, primitives/buffers.scm,
	primitives/features.scm, primitives/format.scm,
	primitives/time.scm, primitives/guile.scm, primitives/keymaps.scm,
	primitives/lists.scm, primitives/load.scm, primitives/match.scm,
	primitives/numbers.scm, primitives/pure.scm, primitives/read.scm,
	primitives/signal.scm, primitives/strings.scm,
	primitives/symprop.scm, primitives/system.scm, primitives/fns.scm:
	New files.

	* features.scm, format.scm, fset.scm, guile.scm, keymaps.scm,
	lists.scm, load.scm, match.scm, numbers.scm, pure.scm, read.scm,
	signal.scm, strings.scm, symprop.scm, system.scm, time.scm,
	trace.scm: Removed files.
	
2001-10-23  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	* match.scm (string-match): New implementation using new
	`make-emacs-regexp' primitive; old workaround implementation
	renamed to `string-match-workaround'.

2001-10-21  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	* transform.scm (m-defun, m-defmacro, m-let, m-defvar,
	m-defconst): Use more selective tracing mechanism (provided by new
	file trace.scm).
	
	* symprop.scm (get, boundp), transform.scm (transform-lambda,
	m-defmacro): Remove unnecessary uses of nil-ify and t-ify.
	
	* match.scm (string-match): Workaround Guile/libc regex
	parenthesis bug.

	* emacs.scm: Move elisp primitive definitions into more specific
	files, so that emacs.scm contains only overall code.

	* Makefile.am: Added new files.
	
	* numbers.scm, trace.scm, time.scm, pure.scm, system.scm,
	read.scm, calling.scm, guile.scm: New files.

2001-10-20  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	* Makefile.am (elisp_sources): Added match.scm and strings.scm.

	* match.scm, strings.scm: New files.

2001-10-19  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	* transform.scm: Replace uses of `nil' by `#f' or `'()'.

	* Makefile.am (elisp_sources): Added lists.scm.

	* load.scm (the-elisp-module): Corrected (lang elisp emacs) module
	name.

	* lists.scm (lang): New file containing list-related primitives.

	* emacs.scm: Corrected module name.

2001-10-19  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	Initial implementation of an Emacs Lisp translator, based on
	transformer code originally written by Mikael Djurfeldt.
	
	* Makefile.am, .cvsignore: New.

	* ChangeLog, README, buffers.scm, emacs.scm, features.scm,
	format.scm, fset.scm, keymaps.scm, load.scm, signal.scm,
